.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vmgr_querytape_byte_u64
queries the CASTOR Volume Manager about a tape.
.TP
.I vid
is the volume visual identifier.
It must be at most CA_MAXVIDLEN characters long.
.TP
.I dgn
points at a buffer to receive the device group name corresponding to
the tape.
The buffer must be at least CA_MAXDGNLEN+1 characters long.
.TP
.I etime
indicates the time the volume was entered in the Volume Manager.
.TP
.I free_space
in kbytes.
.TP
.I nbfiles
number of files written on the tape.
.TP
.I rcount
number of times the volume has been mounted for read.
.TP
.I wcount
number of times the volume has been mounted for write.
.TP
.I rhost
indicates the last tape server where the tape was mounted for read.
.TP
.I whost
indicates the last tape server where the tape was mounted for write.
.TP
.I rjid
is the job id of the last read request.
.TP
.I wjid
is the job id of the last write request.
.TP
.I rtime
indicates the last time the volume was mounted for read.

will be returned as a combination of
.BR ARCHIVED ,
.BR DISABLED ,
.BR EXPORTED ,
.BR TAPE_BUSY ,
.BR TAPE_FULL
and
.BR TAPE_RDONLY .

Only
.I vid
or
.I tape_info
are mandatory. When a pointer to a field is NULL, the field value is not returned.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This routine returns 0 if the operation was successful or -1 if the operation
failed. In the latter case,
.B serrno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS

.TP
.B EFAULT
.I vid
or
.I tape_info
is a NULL pointer.
.TP
.B EINVAL
The length of
.I vid
exceeds
.BR CA_MAXVIDLEN .
