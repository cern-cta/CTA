/** @mainpage CASTOR New Stager API Proposal
 * $RCSfile: stager_client_api.h,v $ $Revision: 1.46 $
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 * The new API for the CASTOR stager has been based on the requirements for the 
 * new internal design of the stager. It differs from the previous CASTOR Stager
 * API as we have tried to keep the same names and concepts as in the 
 * Grid Storage Resource Manager (SRM) v2.1.
 * c.f. http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 *
 * 
 * The stager API allows to contact the CASTOR disk pool manage(stager), so as to
 * put or get file into/from CASTOR. There calls to get files from CASTOR
 * (stage_get, stage_prepareToGet, stage_getNext) or to put files into the system (stage_put,
 * stage_prepareToPut). The other calls deal with file meta-data (stage_putDone,
 * stage_changeFileStatus) or queries.
 * So here's the summary of our last discussion with Olof, regarding these points:
 *
 * 1) Writing files to CASTOR
 *
 * Two calls are available to put files into CASTOR:
 *
 * - stage_prepareToPut which creates the file on CASTOR, and reserves space on a diskserver
 * but does not schedule a mover to access the file. This call allows to create several 
 * files in one go. It is necessary to call stage_put to actually access the data. 
 * Furthermore, when a file is created with this call, it is not migrated automatically,
 * put stage_putDone must be used to make sure that this happens (the stager might howvere have
 * a maximum time for files to stay on disk only, and decide to force a migration).
 *
 * - stage_put which can behave in two ways;
 * Called after stagePrepareToPut, it just schedules access to the file, and the status 
 * stays STAGEOUT when the mover exits (this takes care of use case 3 (see below).
 * Called on its own, it will reserve the space (possibly using defaults values)  
 * and will schedule access to the file. This mode will be used for POSIX file access to CASTOR
 *
 * Concerning concurrency when several users write to a file, we do not guarantee consistency 
 * (we have no such thing as transctions); As a matter of fact, the stagePutDone function doesn't even 
 * need the request id of the prepare to put request, as in the SRM, as this doesn't 
 * bring any more consistency anyway.
 *
 * 2) Getting files from CASTOR
 *
 * Several calls are available to get data from CASTOR.:
 * 
 * - stage _prepareToGet starts recalling the a number of files from tape. It returns immadiately
 * (equivalent to the old stagein --nowait) and does NOT schedule I/O access to the file.
 * It is then necessary to call either stage_get or stage_getNext to access the data.
 * It is possible to prioritize the files in the request by using the priority field in
 * the struct stage_prepareToGet_filerequest. Request with lower priority are processed first,
 *
 * - stage _prepareToUpdate is a cross between prepareToGet and prepareToPut. It recalls the file
 * from tape and allows opening it in write mode (with stage_getNext or stage_update). 
 * To allow the file to be migrated back to tape, stage_putDone must be called.
 * 
 * - stage_get which can behave in two ways;
 * Called after stage_prepareToGet, it just schedules access to the file, blocking
 * while the file is being recalled, until is is finally on disk. The file is opemned in read-only
 * mode.
 *
 * - stage_update which behaves like stage_get except that the file is opened in write mode.
 *
 * - stage_getNext which can be used to process the file brought back from tape
 * by a stage_prepareToGet request, as soon as they are ready to be accessed.
 * This call blocks until the next file is ready to be accessed, the order depending on
 * which files were faster to get from the store (this is optimized by the stager).
 *
 * After the the file have been used, calling stage_releaseFiles on the un-necessary files
 * can help the grabage collection on the stager.
 *
 * @section uc Use Cases for the Stager API
 *
 * 1) User reading/writing a file with rfio_open
 *
 * In this case, the RFIO API does the proper StageGet/StagePut operation
 * according to the mode in which the file is opened. The Stager schedules
 * the request (i.e. space allocation and get from tape if necessary) and
 * then starts the mover. This covers POSIX data access to CASTOR (and CDR as well ?)
 *
 * 2)  User Job doing pre-staging
 *
 * At the beginning of the job, the user calls StageGet with the list of
 * files he is going to use in the job. The StageGet is done with the "no
 * wait" option, and subsequent data access is going to be done using
 * rfio_open (c.f. use case 1.1).
 *
 * 3) Grid user using SRM to copy a file to CASTOR
 *
 * A user first call SrmPrepareToPut (calling ateg_prepareToPut) to create a file
 * in CASTOR. He is returned a tURL (which form is still to decide) that he
 * can use to write to the file using GridFTP.
 * GridFTP opens the file (possibly several times in parallel, if it is a
 * multi-stream transfer) and writes the data.
 * When the transfer is done, the user calls SrmPutDone (which itself calls
 * stage_putDone) specifying the castor filename(s), as well as the request ID.
 *
 * 4) New Stager User using the new API to acess its data.
 *
 * A user calls StageGet on multiple files, which he has to analyze independently.
 * He specifies a callback, which is called by the API for each file as soon as it
 * is staged (no order is guaranteed, the callback is called as soon as the file is
 * available).
 *
 * @section diff_old_stager  Differences with old stager API
 * - The physical pathname of the files is not shown any more. Every file access must 
 *   be duly scheduled using the proper method.
