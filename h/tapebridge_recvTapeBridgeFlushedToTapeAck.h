/**
 * Receives a TAPEBRIDGE_FLUSHEDTOTAPE acknowledgment message using the

 *
 * This function will return success no matter what the value of the status
 * field of the received acknowledgement message.  The caller of this function

 * @param socketFd            The file-descriptor of the socket to be read

 * @param netReadWriteTimeout The timeout in seconds to be used when performing
 *                            network reads and writes.
 * @param msg                 Output: The received acknowledgement message.
 * @return                    If successful then the number of bytes read from
