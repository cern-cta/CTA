.SH DESCRIPTION
.B modifySvcClass
modifies an existing service class definition in the CASTOR stager catalogue
.LP
This command requires database client access to the stager catalogue
.TP
.BI \-h,
.BI \-\-help
Get usage information
.TP
.BI \-\-Name " name"
is the name of an existing service class. An error is printed and the command
fails if no service class with the specified name is found
.TP
.BI \-\-Nbdrives " nbDrives"
The number of tape drives this service class is allowed to use concurrently
for migration. There is no service class attribute to control the number tape drives used
for tape recall.
.TP
.BI \-\-DefaultFileSize " defaultFileSize"
The default file size allocation for
.IR 'stagePut'
requests not specifying any filesize.
.TP
.BI \-\-MaxReplicaNb " maxReplicaNb"
Specifies the maximum number of disk resident replicas for a given CASTOR file
allowed for files recalled or created in this service class. Note that specifying
zero (0) replica, allows for an umlimited number of replicas (not recommended
unless a replication policy is specified, see below). If this option is not
specified or if a negative number is given, the default of one (1) replica is
applied.
.TP
.BI \-\-GcPolicy " gcPolicy"
Specifies the name of the garbage collection policy to be used for this service
class. The policy should either be a database procedure or an executable external
script known to the CASTOR expert system (see the
.BI expertd(1castor)
man-page). If an empty string ("") is provided the existing policy setting (if any) will
be revoked.
.TP
.BI \-\-StreamPolicy " streamPolicy"
Specifies the name of the stream policy to be used for this service class. The policy
will be used to determine the number of streams that should be running based on the
number of files and volume of data that should be written too tape. If an empty string ("") 
is provided the existing policy setting (id any) will be revoked
.TP
.BI \-\-ForcedFileClass " forcedFileClass"
Specifies the name of the file class to force on files written to this service class. The
forced file class overrides the file class that the user specifies.
. If an empty string ("") the file class that the file was written too will be used.
.TP
.BI \-\-DiskOnlyBehavior " [yes|no]"
Defines whether or not this file class has disk only behavior. The supported values
are yes or no, 1 or 0 and are case-insensitive.
.TP
.BI \-\-MigratorPolicy " migratorPolicy"
Specifies the name of the migrator policy to be used for this service
class. The policy should either be an executable external script known to the CASTOR
expert system (see the
.BI expertd(1castor)
man-page). If an empty string ("") is provided the existing policy setting (if any) will
be revoked.
.TP
.BI \-\-RecallerPolicy " recallerPolicy"
Specifies the name of the recaller policy to be used for this service
class. The policy should either be an executable external script known to the CASTOR
expert system (see the
.BI expertd(1castor)
man-page). If an empty string ("") is provided the existing policy setting (if any) will
be revoked.
.TP
.BI \-\-ReplicationPolicy " replicationPolicy"
Specifies the name of the replication policy to be used for this service
class. The policy should either be an executable external script known to the CASTOR
expert system (see the
.BI expertd(1castor)
man-page). If an empty string ("") is provided the existing policy setting (if any) will
be revoked. If a replication policy is specified, the
.BI \-\-MaxReplicaNb
option (see above) is ignored.
.TP
.BI \-\-AddTapePools " tapePool1:tapePool2:..."
Lists the names of the tape pools that are to be added to the service class. If
any of the specified tape pools does not exist in the stager catalog, it will be
created and linked to the service class. If more than one tape pool is specified,
the names should be separated by colon (:). A warning is printed if one or
more of the specified tape pools are already associated with the service class.
.TP
.BI \-\-RemoveTapePools " tapePool1:tapePool2:..."
Lists the names of the tape pools that are to be removed from the service class.
 If more than one tape pool is specified, the names should be separated by
colon (:).  A warning is printed if one or more of the specified tape pools
are not associated with the service class.
.TP
.BI \-\-AddDiskPools " diskPool1:diskPool2:..."
Lists the names of the disk pools that are to be added to the service class. If
any of the specified disk pools does not exist in the stager catalog, it will be
created and linked to the service class. If more than one disk pool is specified,
the names should be separated by colon (:). A warning is printed if one or
more of the specified disk pools are already associated with the service class.
.BI \-\-RemoveDiskPools " diskPool1:diskPool2:..."
Lists the names of the disk pools that are to be removed from the service class. If
more than one disk pool is specified, the names should be separated by colon (:).
A warning is printed if one or more of the specified disk pools are not associated
with the service class.
.LP
A service class groups together the resources and the storage attributes and policies
governing the disk resident files. The resources are composed by the disk pools
that the service class should use for client user requests for creating new files
as well as requests for files that need to be recalled from tape. The tape pools
are only relevant for the tape migration.

The SvcClass together with the FileClass attributes defined in the stager catalogue
are used to determine, for instance, how many copies and which tape pools should
be used when migrating the file to tape (see
.B NOTES
section below).
.SH EXIT STATUS
This program returns 0 if the operation was successful or >0 if the operation
failed.

.SH NOTES
The definition of FileClass and SvcClass classes in the stager catalogue is
an important change with the new CASTOR stager. The previous CASTOR stgdaemon,
toke the following important migration parameters from the CASTOR name server:
number of copies on tape, the tape pools to be used and the maximum number of
drives to be used when starting the migration streams. Those attributes are now
defined in the FileClass and SvcClass tables of the stager catalogue. The
basic motivation for this change was to be able to disentangle file attributes
such as number of tape copies from resource attributes such as how many drives
should be used for migration.
