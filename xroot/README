This directory contains the source to build the xrootd/olbd interface to CERN's
CASTOR2 system. It is only supported for linux platforms as this is the only
platform support by the Castor service. Follow the steps:

1) cd to the xrootd directory (the enclosing directory).
2) Run bootstrap.sh (autotools) or configure.classic.
3) Compile, as needed the xroot/olb source tree.
4) cd into this directory (xrootd/src/XrdCS2)
5) Look at configure and change tge definition of the location of the include
   directory and the castor library director, if need be.
6) execute ./configure
7) Issue gmake to compile the contents therin.

The following will be built:

a) In bin: XrdCS2d      - the daemon run by xrootd on each disk server node.
                          Normally, istalled in "/xroot/bin".

b) in lib: libXrdCS2.so - the XMI library used by the olbd on the Castor server.
                          Normally, istalled in "/xroot/lib".

This directory also contains XrdCS2e which is a shell script that also needs
to be installed on each disk server (normally, in "/xroot/bin").

This directory also has sample configuration files:

xrd.cf.standalone - to run the system without clustering support
xrd.cf.clustered  - to run the system with    clustering support

More information can be found in the reference guide:
