.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B stager_update
command starts a put/update session in CASTOR. It is primarily intended
for applications that need to open the same set of files several times (e.g. for updates).
In addition the command pre-stages the existing CASTOR files from tape to disk.
It only supports asychronous stage-in operation meaning that it returns immediately
after the stager has stored and acknowledged the request. The command does not wait for the
files to be staged in and it is supposed to be used in conjunction with the
.B stager_qry(1castor)
command to check the progress of the request.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI \-M,\ \-\-filename " hsmfile"
specifies the CASTOR HSM file(s) to be staged in. The
.B \-M
option can be repeated, allowing to stage in several files with a single command.
.TP
.BI \-S,\ \-\-service_class " service_class"
specifies the service class to be used when staging in the file. If no service class
is given a default will be assigned by the stager.
.TP
.BI \-U,\ \-\-usertag " usertag"
allows for associating a usertag that can be used for identifying the request in a subsequent
.B stager_qry(1castor)
command.
.TP
.BI \-r,\ \-\-display_reqid
if specified, the request identifier asssigned by the stager will be printed to standard
output. The request identifier can be used instead of the castor filenames when closing
the put-session with
.BI stager_putdone(1castor)
.TP
.BI \-h,\ \-\-help
display command usage help
