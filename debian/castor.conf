# The following option defines in bytes the maximum size of a message that can be
# read by a client or server. The default value and minimum value is 20MB
# Note: it is not advised to modify this value unless recommended to do so by the
# CASTOR team.

#CLIENT  MAX_NETDATA_SIZE 20971520

# Maximum number of responses allowed when a file query using reqexp is done. Default

## Service Configuration ############################################################

# The default port on which the request handler should listen. Note that this can
# be overwritten by environment variable and command line argument

#RH PORT 9002
#RH SEC_PORT 9007

# The RH/SRMHostsList is the list of nodes running a CASTOR SRM service. This allows

# only if the machine from which it comes is declared in this list. By default this
# feature is disabled.
#RH SRMHostsList

# The CNS/CONRETRY option defines how often nameserver clients should attempt to

# times. Which in conjunction with the CNS connection retry interval is approx 1 week
#CNS    CONRETRY        38880

# The CNS/CONRETRYINT option defines how long in seconds, nameserver clients should
# wait before making new attempts to connect to the nameserver should it be
# unavailable
#CNS    CONRETRYINT     60

# The following option defines whether or not file checksum information generated by

# insensitive and the default value is NO. Note: This functionality requires the
# the name server to be running version 2.1.8 or newer of the CASTOR2 software and
# that the RFIOD/USE_CKSUM option is enabled on all diskservers.
#CNS    USE_CKSUM       YES

# rmMasterDaemon (Resource Monitoring Daemon)
#   - responsible for collecting monitoring information from rmNodeDaemon's and
#     managing state information
#
# The frequency at which the rmMasterDaemon updates/synchronises the monitoring
# information stored in the shared memory to the stager database

#RmMaster UpdateInterval        10

# Defines the maximum amount of time in seconds that an rmNodeDaemon can be out of
# contact with the rmMasterDaemon before automatically being set to a disabled state.
# A value of -1 disables this check

#RmMaster HeartbeatTimeout      60

#   - responsible for collecting monitoring information from diskservers and
#     reporting the collected data back to the rmMasterDaemon.
#   - Also responsible for sub directory creation in mount points!!
#
# Defines the frequency in seconds that state updates are sent to the rmMasterDaemon.
# This includes the status of the node and slow moving metrics like total memory and
# total swap which does not vary outside of reboots

#RmNode  StateUpdateInterval    60

# about the filesystems defined in RmNode/MountPoints.

#RmNode  MetricsUpdateInterval  10
#RmNode  MountPoints            /srv/castor/01/ /srv/castor/02/ /srv/castor/03/

# The location of the nodes status file detailing the status of the disk server and
# its associated filesystems as seen by the central server.
#
# Note: The rmNodeDaemon always sends a status of PRODUCTION, this status can only
#    be changed by forcing it into another state via the use of rmAdminNode. As the
#    the state reported by the client is always PRODUCTION the status file can be
#    used to provide input to third party monitoring systems as to the true status
#    of the diskserver i.e. how the LSF plugin and stager see the diskserver.

#RmNode  StatusFile             /etc/castor/status

# The following definition allow the min, max and minallowed free space to be defined
# at the disk server level respectively.

#RmNode          MinFreeSpace           .10
#RmNode          MaxFreeSpace           .15
#RmNode          MinAllowedFreeSpace    .05

# scheduler (LSF 7.0 plugin)
#
# The following values define the predicated cost of starting a new job on a
# filesystem once that filesystem has been selected to run a job. A predicated value
# is  required to compensate for the latency of monitoring information between the
# client and rmMasterDaemon. So for example, if a job is selected to run on
# filesystem A for a read the monitoring information for the number of read streams
# will be incremented by the value of jobNbReadStreamCost.

#SchedCoeffs     jobReadRateCost          1000     # bytes/second
#SchedCoeffs     jobWriteRateCost         1000     # bytes/second
#SchedCoeffs     jobNbReadStreamCost      1
#SchedCoeffs     jobNbReadWriteStreamCost 1
#SchedCoeffs     jobNbWriteStreamCost     1

# The following definition defines the location where the plugin should write the
# scheduler notification files. The directory should be writeable by lsfadmin

Sched   SharedLSFResource       /var/www/html/lsf

# The Sched/PolicyModule defines the location of the Python module used to select
# the best filesystem and diskserver to be used to run a transfer job.

#Sched  PolicyModule            /etc/castor/policies/scheduler.py

# The location of the Python shared object library.

#Sched  DynamicPythonLib        /usr/lib64/libpython2.3.so

# The following option defines how long in seconds a job is allowed to remain in a
# queue waiting for resources before being killed by the job manager. For
# convenience, a svcclass name of "all" can be used to define a default value for
# all service classes. Changes to this option can be done without a job manager
# restart.
#
# The format of the value is:
#   <svcclass1>:<timeout1> [svcclass2:timeout2[...]]

#JobManager     PendingTimeouts         all:120 default:120

# Defines how long in seconds that a disk2disk copy job can be in a pending state
# before being terminate in seconds. This value is global for all service classes.

#JobManager     DiskCopyPendingTimeout  7800

# The MaxDiskCopyRunTime defines the maximum amount of time that a disk2disk copy
# job is allowed to run for in seconds before being killed by LSF. This helps
# reclaim job slots from replication jobs which are stuck when one end of the
# transfer disappears while the file is being replicated. E.g a diskserver crash.
#
# The default value is 18000 seconds (5 hours wallclock) and this functionality can
# be disabled by setting a value of -1.

#JobManager     MaxDiskCopyRunTime 18000

# Should the job manager kill jobs whose resource requirements e.g requested
# filesystems can no longer be satisfied ? [yes|no]. The default is yes. Changes to
# this option can be done without a job manager restart.

#JobManager     ResReqKill      yes

# The ManagementInterval option defines how often the job manager should query LSF in
# order to determine if an action needs to be taken on behalf of jobs waiting for
# execution. Such actions include: notifying the stager of jobs killed via a call to
# bkill and terminating jobs that have been in a PEND'ing status for too long.
#
# Note: the value must be greater then 10 seconds. The management functionality can
# be disabled completely by setting a value of 0.

#JobManager     ManagementInterval      60

# How many times should the job manager try and submit a job into LSF before giving
# up and terminate the request? The default value is 3 times.

#JobManager     SubmitRetryAttempts     3

# The SubmitRetryInterval defines how long in seconds the job manager should wait
# between retry attempts to submit a job into LSF. The default values is 5 seconds.

#JobManager     SubmitRetryInterval     5

# Should the job manager perform reverse uid lookups on all new job requests? [yes|no]
# The default value is yes.

#JobManager     ReverseUidLookups       yes

# In order to improve submission speeds into LSF the job manager pre creates a number
# of child processes which are instructed to submit jobs into LSF. This eliminates
# the need to fork a independent process for every submission.
#
# Note: the value must be less then 200. Setting the value too high could kill the
#       LSF master, the default is 2

#JobManager     PreforkedWorkers        2

# As notifications files can be served from a web server it is necessary to also
# define the location where the Job (stagerJob) should go to retrieve the file. The
# location must be prefixed with file:// or http:// to denote whether the file is on
# a shared filesystem or served via web server. E.g. file:///usr/share/lsf/castor_job
#
# When using http:// as a URI (Uniform resource indicator) it is possible to specify
# the download server using the LSB_MASTERNAME keyword. This keyword will be
# replaced at runtime by the name of the current LSF master.

JobManager      SharedLSFResource       http://castorscheduler.cern.ch/lsf

# The RetryAttempts option defines how many times stagerJob should try and download
# the notification file written by the scheduler. This option only applies to http://
# downloads

#Job    RetryAttempts   60

# The RetryInterval defines how long in seconds the stagerJob process should
# wait between retry attempts to download the notification file written by the
# scheduler at the location specified by the JobManager/SharedLSFResource option.
# This option only applies to http:// downloads

#Job    RetryInterval   10

# The RetryAttempts option defines how many times diskCopyTransfer should try and
# download the notification file written by the scheduler. This option only applies
# to http:// downloads

#DiskCopy       RetryAttempts   60

# The RetryInterval defines how long in seconds the diskCopyTransfer process should
# wait between retry attempts to download the notification file written by the
# scheduler at the location specified by the JobManager/SharedLSFResource option.
# This option only applies to http:// downloads

#DiskCopy       RetryInterval   10

# The frequency at which the GC daemon checks the stager to see whether there are
# files to be removed on the diskserver. This value is represented in seconds.

#GC      Interval       300

# The SyncInterval is the frequency in seconds between full rechecks of the
# diskservers contents with the stager catalog and nameserver. I.e once the
# synchronization check is complete, the GC daemon will wait SyncInterval seconds
# before starting the next round of checks. To disable all synchronization checks
# set this value to 0

#GC      SyncInterval   1800

# The ChunkSize defines the number of files that the GC daemon should synchronize
# with the stager catalog and nameserver in one go. Note: the largest value is 3000

#GC      ChunkSize      2000

# The ChunkInterval is the frequency in seconds between synchronization queries to
# the stager catalog and nameserver. I.e the interval between two bulk checks of
# size ChunkSize

#GC      ChunkInterval  120

# By default the startup of the GC daemon is deliberately offset by a random interval
# between 1 and 15 minutes. This randomized delay should prevent all GC's in an
# castor2 instance from deleting files at the same time causing an oscillation in
# incoming network traffic due to deletions. By uncommenting this line, you force the
# garbage collection to ignore this starting delay.

#GC      ImmediateStart yes

# This option allows to disable the synchronization between the diskservers and the
# stager catalog. The synchronization with the nameserver is not affected.

#GC      DisableStagerSync no
