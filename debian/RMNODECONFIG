## The list of filesystems to survey
#
# Please replace and uncomment the following
# After every filesystem you can say PARTITION=<partition>
# in case rmnode appears to fail finding the partition
# associated to the filesystem. This partition is used
# to get I/O statistics on the filesystem. That's why
# there is a special PARTITION=xfs stanza in case your
# filesystem is of type xfs (xfs maintains I/O statistics
# in /proc/fs/xfs/stat)
#
# Other stanzas are:
# LOCALACCESS		Say to rmmaster that clients accessing this filesystem
#			should be local
# SPACEFREQUENCY	frequency_of_space_check_in_second_unit
# IORATEFREQUENCY	frequency_of_io_check_in_second_unit
# NICKNAME		forces nickname (last component)
#
#/data01
#/data02	PARTITION=xfs
#/data03	SPACEFREQUENCY=30
