castor (2.1.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Two bug fixes in the prepare to get not-scheduled:
     - CreateRecallCandidate in stager_db_service now is doing errors check.
     - OraStagerSvc.cpp  bug fix in how the exceptions are thrown for createRecallCandidate.
   * Bug Fix for Repack:
     - castor::castor::Exception instead of castor::exception::Internal thrown by functions in the DatabaseHelper,
     - fix for monitoring to be able to deal with stager time out,
     - bug fix in repack worker. 
   * Fixed the socket leak in DLF client when the DLF server is not reachable

   * Modifications on the PL/SQL
     - optimized version of stage_qry
     - fixes for the processing of update requests
     - fixed the reservedSpace accumulation problem
     - fixed garbage collector job

    [r1.16,2006-10-05,felixehm] in case of restart, only the files in invalid status are send again.
    [r1.15,2006-10-03,felixehm] restart also resets the stats of a repacksubrequest

  * CASTOR2/castor/repack/RepackServer.cpp:
  * CASTOR2/castor/repack/RepackServer.hpp:
    [r1.21,2006-10-05,felixehm] Added new Module: RepackFileChecker.
    [r1.21,2006-10-05,felixehm] It retrieves the filenames from NS, checks for multicopy, sets a new status
    [r1.21,2006-10-05,felixehm] to the RepackSubRequest (TOBESTGAED) and stores it. This was done before in
    [r1.21,2006-10-05,felixehm] the RepackFileStager, but there was a risk that the insertion and update of
    [r1.21,2006-10-05,felixehm] the segments slows down the RepackFileStager.
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm] fixed DLF Messages
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm]
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm] added overriding of parseCommandLine of BaseServer, since we want the
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm] repackserver to run in a synchronised mode. This is necessary, after a
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm] crash while storing Segments into DB, because this will cause the
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm] repackserver to send the request again when restarted. Since this causes
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm] the Stager to create another TapeCopy, this has to be avoided.
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm] The synchronising mode allows the user only to retrieve the segment
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm] information from NS and update the DB without sending the request.
    [r1.20,2006-10-03,felixehm]

    [r1.22,2006-09-28,felixehm] Modified error Message in case of wrong VID

    [r 1.7,2006-05-15,felixehm] lets say, this is a nicer solution than iterating twice over all segments of file
    [r 1.7,2006-05-15,felixehm] to find the copyno and then the segments with this copyno.

    [r1.53,2006-09-04,kotlyar] is duplicated if it has several file systems except the information about a local disk;
    [r1.53,2006-09-04,kotlyar] each node/filesystem features must be described in the maui.cfg;
    [r1.53,2006-09-04,kotlyar] all nodes and jobs have default partition for scheduler;
    [r1.53,2006-09-04,kotlyar] jobs use hostlist field from wiki 1.1 for the requested filesystem parameter.

    [r1.300,2006-09-11,itglp] Fixing some outer join queries for repack
    [r1.299,2006-09-08,felixehm] Added changements for StageRepackRequest scheduling,quering, etc.
    [r1.298,2006-09-06,sponcec3] Fixed putStart to take into account SubRequest cancelation by stageRm during the queuing. This bug was leading to updating DiskCopies to status STAGEOUT while the job was due to fail. After that, all requests were waiting on this STAGEOUT but their parents were put to NULL since the failing STAGEOUT SubRequest was set tO FAILED and thus not found by makeSubReqWait
    [r1.297,2006-09-06,sponcec3] Fixing missing invalidation of DiskCopy in stageRm. This was leading to DiskCopies in WAITFS status with no 'valid' associated SubRequest and thus to an accumulation of SubRequests in WAITSUBREQ status waiting on nothing (null parent)
    [r1.296,2006-09-06,sponcec3] Fixed wrong check of FileSystem and DiskServer status in isSubRequestToSchedule. They were checked even when non applicable, leading to scheduling requests that should have waited
    [r1.295,2006-09-04,sponcec3] Nasty work-around to the nbTapeCopiesInFS problem
    [r1.294,2006-08-16,gtaur] delete of out date now delete only the failed one status in (8,9,10)
    [r1.293,2006-08-14,itglp] Fixed triggers around NbTapeCopiesInFS according to new TapeCopy state diagram. To be still tested.
    [r1.293,2006-08-14,itglp] Better indentation for fileRecalled.
    [r1.292,2006-08-10,sponcec3] Fixed 2 bugs in prepareForMigration/putDoneFunc : the context was not passed properly and the update requests were not taken into account
    [r1.291,2006-08-07,itglp] Fixed DiskPool2ServiceClass -> DiskPool2SvcClass
    [r1.290,2006-08-07,itglp] Added missing ';'
    [r1.289,2006-08-07,itglp] From Nilo: changed sequence cache from 200 to 300, added PK in DP2SC.
    [r1.289,2006-08-07,itglp] Fixed' and commented out tr_Stream2TapeCopy_Delete. To be fully understood
    [r1.289,2006-08-07,itglp] yet what's wrong around the triggers around NBTapeCopiesInFS.
    [r1.289,2006-08-07,itglp] Removed VDQM2 specific code, added to an upcoming oracleTrailer.
    [r1.288,2006-08-07,sponcec3] Some improvements in anyTapeCopyForStream thanks to Olof. We were not taking into account the status of the filesystems and diskservers
    [r1.287,2006-08-03,sponcec3] Fix stupid mistake in updateFiles2Delete
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] Added internalputDoneFunc:
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] in fact an extraction from putDoneFunc. It creates a specified number
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] of tapecopies for a diskcopy in STAGEOUT. This number is passed as a
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] parameter.
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] 
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] Changed fileRecalled:
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] Whenever a file is recalled its repackvid in the subrequest is checked and
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] for each found 'repack-subrequest' for this file the number of tapecopies
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] are created. Only subrequest in WAITTAPERECALL,WAITSUBREQ and READY are
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] considered. This is neccessary for >1 tapecopy repacking (otherwise only
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] one tapecopy is created for the migration).
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] 
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] 
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] Changed putDoneFunc:
    [r1.286,2006-08-02,felixehm] Reduced by the extracted part now in internalputDoneFunc
    [r1.285,2006-08-02,sponcec3] Fixed the cleaning of the DiskCopy in case of put failure. This was leading to orphaned DiskCopies
    [r1.284,2006-07-21,sponcec3] Fixed some deadlock between the GC and the updateFsFileClosed PL/SQL function
    [r1.283,2006-07-13,sponcec3] Fixed nullGCPolicy so that Invalid files are deleted
    [r1.282,2006-07-07,itglp] Create main id sequence with bigger cache (optimization from Nilo)
    [r1.281,2006-07-06,itglp] Improved internalStageQuery (credits to Eric).
    [r1.281,2006-07-06,itglp] Fix for bug #17948: after a put, any existing castorFile having the same lastKnownFileName
    [r1.281,2006-07-06,itglp] but different fileid will be reset to lastKnownFileName = '' so to avoid false
    [r1.281,2006-07-06,itglp] duplicates in queries.
    [r1.281,2006-07-06,itglp] Fixed comments.
    [r1.280,2006-07-04,felixehm] Added new Status for the Stager SubRequest. This is needed for the handling
    [r1.280,2006-07-04,felixehm] of a file in a repakc process. In the recaller part, the new status is set,
    [r1.280,2006-07-04,felixehm] instead of archiving the subrequest. In case of a repack the subrequest life
    [r1.280,2006-07-04,felixehm] is not over, when the file is recalled. We extend the validation of it by this
    [r1.280,2006-07-04,felixehm] special state for repack.
    [r1.280,2006-07-04,felixehm] Note that at the end of the repack process (migration) the subrequest is set to
    [r1.280,2006-07-04,felixehm] archived (see OraTapeSvc  -->checkFileForRepack).
    [r1.279,2006-06-22,itglp] Fixed FS trigger for GC
    [r1.279,2006-06-22,itglp] Attempt to add a revision into CastorVersion table
    [r1.278,2006-06-19,sponcec3] Yet another fix on updateFsFileClosed
    [r1.277,2006-06-14,sponcec3] Fixed a missing condition on the select defining which is the prepareToPut statement to delete on a putDone
    [r1.276,2006-06-13,sponcec3] Fix last fix of GC
    [r1.275,2006-06-13,sponcec3] Make disk2diskCopy wait when the replicated file is in STAGEOUT. And wake it up after the put done
    [r1.274,2006-06-09,itglp] Fix defaultGCPolicy to delete INVALID diskcopies first
    [r1.274,2006-06-09,itglp] bug introduced in v. 1.248)
    [r1.273,2006-06-09,sponcec3] Fix isSubRequestToSchedule. This was allowing replications of STAGEOUT diskcopies in case replication was enabled and several svcclasses were defines
    [r1.272,2006-06-09,sponcec3] Fix (again !) fsupdateFileClosed
    [r1.271,2006-06-08,sponcec3] Fixes the previous fix
    [r1.270,2006-06-08,sponcec3] Fixed a deadlock in updateFsFileClosed
    [r1.269,2006-06-01,itglp] Fixed bug in GC procedure
    [r1.268,2006-05-30,felixehm] Fixed wrong set of diskcopy status.
    [r1.268,2006-05-30,felixehm] If a file is recalled we want to have the diskcopy in 0,
    [r1.268,2006-05-30,felixehm] otherwise for repack purpose we want to have it in 6.
    [r1.267,2006-05-29,itglp] Added index hints in fileNameStageQuery (from Nilo)
    [r1.267,2006-05-29,itglp] Moved fileRecalled after putDoneFunc
    [r1.267,2006-05-29,itglp] Fixed statement in stageRm
    [r1.266,2006-05-26,itglp] Added new indexes.
    [r1.266,2006-05-26,itglp] Optimized bestTapeCopyForStream (thanks to Nilo).
    [r1.266,2006-05-26,itglp] Fixed several queries related to SubRequest.status: now a NOT IN (...) clause
    [r1.266,2006-05-26,itglp] is present nowhere and all the states are mentioned explicitly, properly
    [r1.266,2006-05-26,itglp] taking into account the new ARCHIVED one.
    [r1.266,2006-05-26,itglp] Improved GC trigger, now working fine.
    [r1.265,2006-05-11,felixehm] Added new Stream converter for old SubRequests
    [r1.265,2006-05-11,felixehm] changed sql Procedure filerecalled:
    [r1.265,2006-05-11,felixehm] whenever a file is staged in as a repack request (the new subrequest field
    [r1.265,2006-05-11,felixehm] repackvid is set with the origin tape), the diskcopy status is
    [r1.265,2006-05-11,felixehm] directly put into CANBEMIGRATED.

  * PROTO2/CASTOR.spec:
	[r1.35,2005-09-26,jdurand] Typo %fi -> %endif
	[r1.34,2005-09-26,jdurand] Tentative support of amd64
	[r1.33,2005-09-26,jdurand] Exclude BuildRmMaster also in the RPM execution if there is no LSF available
	[r1.32,2005-09-26,jdurand] Implementation of has_stk_ssi, has_lsf and has_oracle a-la-RPM
	[r1.31,2005-09-22,jdurand] Stop calling 'install' with user/group/mode
	[r1.30,2005-09-15,jdurand] mkdir of etc/castor/expert (because of flows in the current make of CASTOR: until all Imakefiles are changed, we have rules that install not always where they depend from - notion of $(DESTDIR))
	[r1.29,2005-09-15,jdurand] Ugly hack but the problem is architectural: to be able to install somewhere else but in the root filesystem, rules are based on dir/name: constraint, and install in $(DESTDIR)dir/name. Those who construct the value of dir/name is every Imakefile. And they FileName() macro to do that. but we cannot impose FileName() macro to prepend $(DESTDIR) in any case, because FileName() macro is often called several times (i.e. recursively). So, even if the correct solution would be to:
	[r1.29,2005-09-15,jdurand] change config/Imake.rules to depend on $(DESTDIR)dir/name instead of dir/name:
	[r1.29,2005-09-15,jdurand] change ALL (repeat: ALL) Imakefiles/Makefiles to use $(DESTDIR), once, as soon as they build a relative path
	[r1.29,2005-09-15,jdurand] 
	[r1.29,2005-09-15,jdurand] the quick alternative is to touch every file before the build. This horrible thing will guarantee that packaging CASTOR using a tarball made before CASTOR has been locally installed, will anyway correctly install the newly CASTOR in the packaging install path (typically, i.e. in $(DESTDIR))

	[r1.32,2005-09-22,jdurand] Added Recommends: castor-lib, castor-lib-oracle for castor*-conf packages
  * PROTO2/debian/rules:
	[r1.36,2005-09-27,jdurand] A fix to build debs on amd64 (untested)

	[r1.33,2005-09-22,jdurand] Build the *.install from the *.install.perm
	[r1.32,2005-09-15,jdurand] mkdir of etc/castor/expert (because of flows in the current make of CASTOR: until all Imakefiles are changed, we have rules that install not always where they depend from - notion of $(DESTDIR))
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] Ugly hack but the problem is architectural: to be able to install somewhere else but in the root filesystem, rules are based on dir/name: constraint, and install in $(DESTDIR)dir/name. Those who construct the value of dir/name is every Imakefile. And they FileName() macro to do that. but we cannot impose FileName() macro to prepend $(DESTDIR) in any case, because FileName() macro is often called several times (i.e. recursively). So, even if the correct solution would be to:
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] change config/Imake.rules to depend on $(DESTDIR)dir/name instead of dir/name:
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] change ALL (repeat: ALL) Imakefiles/Makefiles to use $(DESTDIR), once, as soon as they build a relative path
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] 
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] the quick alternative is to touch every file before the build. This horrible thing will guarantee that packaging CASTOR using a tarball made before CASTOR has been locally installed, will anyway correctly install the newly CASTOR in the packaging install path (typically, i.e. in $(DESTDIR))
  * PROTO2/debian/stager.init:
	[r 1.3,2005-09-13,jdurand] Always redirect kill output to /dev/null (we handle the error afterwards)

	[r1.11,2005-09-07,jdurand] New prototype: stager_notifyService_v2(), i.e. notification using version 2 of the notif. protocol, where client gives the wanted number of threads
  * PROTO2/hsmtools/cleanLostFiles:
	[r 1.6,2005-09-22,sponcec3] revert previous commit !

  * PROTO2/lib/Imakefile:
	[r1.19,2005-09-23,jdurand] Fixes for static version of libcastorCommonOra
	[r1.18,2005-09-16,jdurand] Re-enable rules for libcastorCommonOra.a that is now included in castor-devel-oracle package
	[r1.17,2005-08-18,itglp] Added rule to remove all .a files in make clean.
	[r1.17,2005-08-18,itglp] Commented out rules to create static libcastorCommonOra.a.
  * PROTO2/makerpm.sh:
	[r 1.2,2005-09-20,jdurand] Do not assume existence of fakeroot when building rpms
  * PROTO2/maketar.sh:
	[r1.33,2005-09-26,jdurand] When building the spec convert /lib/ to /lib64/ instead of /lib to /lib64 (otherwise this too greedy change, affecting file with basename starting with 'lib', like libshift.so!)
	[r1.32,2005-09-26,jdurand] Fix an sed call
	[r1.31,2005-09-26,jdurand] Handle am64 case (where libraries install under /lib64 !)

	[r1.27,2005-09-22,jdurand] Added %attr() in a lot of places
	[r1.26,2005-09-22,jdurand] Now generate the spec using the *.install.perm files
	[r1.25,2005-09-20,jdurand] Added %defattr(-,root,root) to the spec file
	[r1.24,2005-09-15,jdurand] Remove the regexp about architecture: RPM is not good enough to be able to produce subpackages for different architectures (everything is i368, or noarch, or x64_64, or... impossible to distinguish rpms that contains only text than rpms that contain arch-specific things within a single spec file!)
	[r1.23,2005-09-15,jdurand] Added the mechanism to recuperate architecture (not yet translated into rpm language, though)
	[r1.23,2005-09-15,jdurand] Added a blank somewhere in the perl regexp to ensure we catch what we want (was working before, but sounds safer like that)

	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] Ugly hack but the problem is architectural: to be able to install somewhere else but in the root filesystem, rules are based on dir/name: constraint, and install in $(DESTDIR)dir/name. Those who construct the value of dir/name is every Imakefile. And they FileName() macro to do that. but we cannot impose FileName() macro to prepend $(DESTDIR) in any case, because FileName() macro is often called several times (i.e. recursively). So, even if the correct solution would be to:
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] change config/Imake.rules to depend on $(DESTDIR)dir/name instead of dir/name:
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] change ALL (repeat: ALL) Imakefiles/Makefiles to use $(DESTDIR), once, as soon as they build a relative path
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] 
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] the quick alternative is to touch every file before the build. This horrible thing will guarantee that packaging CASTOR using a tarball made before CASTOR has been locally installed, will anyway correctly install the newly CASTOR in the packaging install path (typically, i.e. in $(DESTDIR))
