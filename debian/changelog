And they FileName() macro to do that. but we cannot impose FileName() macro to prepend $(DESTDIR) in any case, because FileName() macro is often called several times (i.e. recursively). So, even if the correct solution would be to:
	[r1.29,2005-09-15,jdurand] change config/Imake.rules to depend on $(DESTDIR)dir/name instead of dir/name:
	[r1.29,2005-09-15,jdurand] change ALL (repeat: ALL) Imakefiles/Makefiles to use $(DESTDIR), once, as soon as they build a relative path
	[r1.29,2005-09-15,jdurand] 
	[r1.29,2005-09-15,jdurand] the quick alternative is to touch every file before the build. This horrible thing will guarantee that packaging CASTOR using a tarball made before CASTOR has been locally installed, will anyway correctly install the newly CASTOR in the packaging install path (typically, i.e. in $(DESTDIR))

	[r1.32,2005-09-22,jdurand] Added Recommends: castor-lib, castor-lib-oracle for castor*-conf packages
  * PROTO2/debian/rules:
	[r1.36,2005-09-27,jdurand] A fix to build debs on amd64 (untested)
	[r1.35,2005-09-26,jdurand] Move creation of $(CURDIR)/debian/castor/usr/lib/perl/CASTOR outside of amd64 or not

	[r1.34,2005-09-26,jdurand] Added pragmas for amd64 (untested)
	[r1.33,2005-09-22,jdurand] Build the *.install from the *.install.perm
	[r1.32,2005-09-15,jdurand] mkdir of etc/castor/expert (because of flows in the current make of CASTOR: until all Imakefiles are changed, we have rules that install not always where they depend from - notion of $(DESTDIR))
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] Ugly hack but the problem is architectural: to be able to install somewhere else but in the root filesystem, rules are based on dir/name: constraint, and install in $(DESTDIR)dir/name. Those who construct the value of dir/name is every Imakefile. And they FileName() macro to do that. but we cannot impose FileName() macro to prepend $(DESTDIR) in any case, because FileName() macro is often called several times (i.e. recursively). So, even if the correct solution would be to:
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] change config/Imake.rules to depend on $(DESTDIR)dir/name instead of dir/name:
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] change ALL (repeat: ALL) Imakefiles/Makefiles to use $(DESTDIR), once, as soon as they build a relative path
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] 
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] the quick alternative is to touch every file before the build. This horrible thing will guarantee that packaging CASTOR using a tarball made before CASTOR has been locally installed, will anyway correctly install the newly CASTOR in the packaging install path (typically, i.e. in $(DESTDIR))

	[r1.11,2005-09-07,jdurand] New prototype: stager_notifyService_v2(), i.e. notification using version 2 of the notif. protocol, where client gives the wanted number of threads
  * PROTO2/hsmtools/cleanLostFiles:
	[r 1.6,2005-09-22,sponcec3] revert previous commit !

	[r1.18,2005-09-16,jdurand] Re-enable rules for libcastorCommonOra.a that is now included in castor-devel-oracle package
	[r1.17,2005-08-18,itglp] Added rule to remove all .a files in make clean.
	[r1.17,2005-08-18,itglp] Commented out rules to create static libcastorCommonOra.a.
  * PROTO2/makerpm.sh:
	[r 1.2,2005-09-20,jdurand] Do not assume existence of fakeroot when building rpms
  * PROTO2/maketar.sh:
	[r1.33,2005-09-26,jdurand] When building the spec convert /lib/ to /lib64/ instead of /lib to /lib64 (otherwise this too greedy change, affecting file with basename starting with 'lib', like libshift.so!)
	[r1.32,2005-09-26,jdurand] Fix an sed call
	[r1.31,2005-09-26,jdurand] Handle am64 case (where libraries install under /lib64 !)

	[r1.26,2005-09-22,jdurand] Now generate the spec using the *.install.perm files
	[r1.25,2005-09-20,jdurand] Added %defattr(-,root,root) to the spec file
	[r1.24,2005-09-15,jdurand] Remove the regexp about architecture: RPM is not good enough to be able to produce subpackages for different architectures (everything is i368, or noarch, or x64_64, or... impossible to distinguish rpms that contains only text than rpms that contain arch-specific things within a single spec file!)
	[r1.23,2005-09-15,jdurand] Added the mechanism to recuperate architecture (not yet translated into rpm language, though)
	[r1.23,2005-09-15,jdurand] Added a blank somewhere in the perl regexp to ensure we catch what we want (was working before, but sounds safer like that)

	[r1.48,2005-09-26,jdurand] Move MANPAGES_STAGER and EMANPAGES_STAGER outside of the #id BuildStagerDaemon
  * PROTO2/stager/stager.c:
	[r1.84,2005-09-13,jdurand] Loop on sleep() every second in the FileSystem thread so that we can catch a signal (killall stager) much more quickly
  * PROTO2/stager/stager_fs_service.c:

	[r1.36,2005-09-27,jdurand] A fix to build debs on amd64 (untested)

	[r1.34,2005-09-26,jdurand] Added pragmas for amd64 (untested)
	[r1.33,2005-09-22,jdurand] Build the *.install from the *.install.perm
	[r1.32,2005-09-15,jdurand] mkdir of etc/castor/expert (because of flows in the current make of CASTOR: until all Imakefiles are changed, we have rules that install not always where they depend from - notion of $(DESTDIR))
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] Ugly hack but the problem is architectural: to be able to install somewhere else but in the root filesystem, rules are based on dir/name: constraint, and install in $(DESTDIR)dir/name. Those who construct the value of dir/name is every Imakefile. And they FileName() macro to do that. but we cannot impose FileName() macro to prepend $(DESTDIR) in any case, because FileName() macro is often called several times (i.e. recursively). So, even if the correct solution would be to:
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] change config/Imake.rules to depend on $(DESTDIR)dir/name instead of dir/name:
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] change ALL (repeat: ALL) Imakefiles/Makefiles to use $(DESTDIR), once, as soon as they build a relative path
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] 
	[r1.31,2005-09-15,jdurand] the quick alternative is to touch every file before the build. This horrible thing will guarantee that packaging CASTOR using a tarball made before CASTOR has been locally installed, will anyway correctly install the newly CASTOR in the packaging install path (typically, i.e. in $(DESTDIR))
  * PROTO2/debian/stager.init:

	[r1.24,2005-09-15,jdurand] Remove the regexp about architecture: RPM is not good enough to be able to produce subpackages for different architectures (everything is i368, or noarch, or x64_64, or... impossible to distinguish rpms that contains only text than rpms that contain arch-specific things within a single spec file!)
	[r1.23,2005-09-15,jdurand] Added the mechanism to recuperate architecture (not yet translated into rpm language, though)
