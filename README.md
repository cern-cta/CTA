## About CTA

The CERN Tape Archive (CTA) is the storage system for the custodial copy of all physics data at CERN. CTA was designed to cope with the huge storage and performance demands of [LHC Run-3](https://home.cern/press/2022/run-3) and beyond.

CTA is:

- The leading Free and Open Source tape data management software
- Home to all the experimental physics data at CERN
- Scalable, for small and large installations
- Self-hostable, on-premise

CTA is designed to operate on physical tape infrastructure and is used in combination with a disk buffer system such as [EOS](https://eos-web.web.cern.ch/eos-web/) or [dCache](https://www.dcache.org/). For development purposes it is also possible to run a containerized setup of the CTA components. For this, you can have a look at the [Development documentation](https://eoscta.docs.cern.ch/latest/dev/introduction/).
