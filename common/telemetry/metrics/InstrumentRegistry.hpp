/**
 * The purpose of this struct is to be able to run and register an instrument init function at start time.
 * This solves two problems:
 * - It ensures all instruments are initialised to a NOOP when the program starts.
 *   This is important to ensure we are not accessing a nullptr when using an instrument
 *   For applications that don't require telemetry, it should not be mandatory to explicitly initialise this to a NOOP.
 *   Take e.g. the CLI tools: they require the catalogue library which has telemetry. It should work out of the box.
 *   Additionally, it also bypasses the need for thread-safety in the initialisation of the instruments
 *   because the init functions are only called once at any given time (at startup, after initialisation, at reset)
 * - It makes the instrument files self-contained and ensures there is a clear dependency hierarchy. This allows these
 *   files to be put into there respective library directories if so desired.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * namespace {
 *     const auto _ = cta::telemetry::metrics::InstrumentRegistrar(myInstrumentInitFunction);
 * }
 *
 * Note that the anonymous namespace is important here and this must be defined in the source file, not the header file
