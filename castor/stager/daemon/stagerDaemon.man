.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI \-f,\ \-\-foreground
runs in foreground mode (no daemonization).
.TP
.BI \-h,\ \-\-help
displays command usage help.
.TP
.BI \-c,\ \-\-config\ <config-file>
specified the location of the configuration file to use. The default value
is /etc/castor/castor.conf.
.TP
.BI \-J,\ \-\-Jthreads\ <nb\ threads>
specifies the number of threads for user job oriented requests. Default is 10.
.TP
.BI \-P,\ \-\-Pthreads\ <nb\ threads>
specifies the number of threads for prestage/repack requests. Default is 6.
.TP
.BI \-S,\ \-\-Sthreads\ <nb\ threads>
specifies the number of threads for stager specific requests (putDone, Rm, setGCWeight). Default is 4.
.TP
.BI \-Q,\ \-\-Qthreads\ <nb\ threads>
specifies the number of threads for user query requests. Default is 10.
.TP
.BI \-E,\ \-\-Ethreads\ <nb\ threads>
specifies the number of threads for handling user errors. Default is 3.
.TP
.BI \-j,\ \-\-jthreads\ <nb\ threads>
specifies the number of threads for internal job oriented requests. Default is 10. It is adviced to have
this at least equal to the number of threads for user job oriented requests, as for each user job there are
two callbacks (for the actual open and close of the file) handled by this thread pool.
.TP
.BI \-G,\ \-\-Gthreads\ <nb\ threads>
specifies the number of threads for internal garbage collection and synchronization. Default is 6.
.TP
.BI \-C,\ \-\-Cthreads\ <nb\ threads>
