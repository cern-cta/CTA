the next call to rmAdminNode for this item.

.TP
.BI \-m,\-\-mountPoint " fileSystemMountPoint"
is the mountPoint of the fileSystem concerned in case you want to modify the states of a filesystem
and not the one of the diskServer itself
.TP
.BI \-R,\-\-recursive
allows to deal with a diskserver and all its fileSystems in one go

In this state, the diskServer is not used at all by the system.
