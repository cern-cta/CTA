Castor messages for internal communication are now described using Google's API protocol buffers.
For writing a message, I let you look at the documentation 
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial or at the existing messages.
The syntax is fairly obvious.

Transforming those messages into C++ code is done only once using these simple commands 
> cd $CASTOR_SRC/castor/messages
> protoc -I=. --cpp_out=. File.proto

That command will generate File.pb.h and File.pb.cc into $CASTOR_SRC/castor/messages
Then File.pb.cc has to be added to $CASTOR_SRC/castor/messages's CMakeList.txt 
(in lib castorMessages)

After add to git the 3 new files (proto, pb.h and pb.cc) and the updated CMakeList 
then commit the changes
