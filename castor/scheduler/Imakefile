COMM We overwrite here the default rule for the compilation of schmod_python in order
COMM to be able to alleviate the -Werror present in the standard flags for the case
COMM of "conversion from string constant to 'char*'". The reason is that some python
COMM headers have changed in python 2.5 from char* to const char*. This produces a
COMM warning that should not be considered as an error. Note that we can (and should)
COMM change our code to pass a const char* but this breaks compatibility with python
COMM 2.3 and 2.4 which are the standards at CERN today (Nov 2009)
COMM the initial rule was :
COMM  $(COMPILE.cpp) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) -Wno-error=write-strings $<
COMM but gcc 3.4 (SLC4) and gcc 4.1 (SLC5) did not recognize the option used
COMM We thus had to go back to -Wno-error for this file
schmod_python.o: schmod_python.cpp
	$(COMPILE.cpp) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) -Wno-error $<
