# Should we run with another limit on the core file size other than the default?
DAEMON_COREFILE_LIMIT=unlimited

# The following option defines how many service classes should run for each
# mighunterd process. By default, the value is 1 indicating that one mighunterd
# process should be started for each service class listed below. If the value
# was 3 for example, then the SVCCLASSES list would be divided into groups of
# 3 and a mighunterd process started for each group.
SVCCLASSES_PER_PROCESS=1

# The list of service classes that the mighunterd should run for. When
# SVCCLASSES_PER_PROCESS is 1 the configuration options for each service
# class can be overwritten using dedicated sysconfig files.
# e.g. /etc/sysconfig/mighunterd.<svcclass>
SVCCLASSES=`listSvcClass`
