.SH NAME
Cupvdaemon \- start the user privilege validation daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Cupvdaemon
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B Cupvdaemon
command starts the user privilege validation daemon.
This command is usually executed at system startup time
.RB ( /etc/rc.local ).
This will read the user privilege validation daemon configuration file,
create a pool of threads and look for requests.
Each of them is processed in a thread which opens a connection to the
database server if necessary.
When a request has been completed, the thread becomes idle until it is allocated
to another request.
The connection to the database server is kept open between 2 requests.
If the name server is being shutdown or not active, the requests are
automatically retried by the client API.
.LP
All error messages and statistical information are kept in a log.
.LP
The user privilege validation daemon listen port number can be defined on client hosts and
on the daemon itself in either of the following ways:
.RS
.LP
setting an environment variable CUPV_PORT
.RS
.HP
setenv CUPV_PORT 56013
.RE
.LP
an entry in
.B /etc/shift.conf
like:
.RS
.HP
CUPV	PORT	56013
.RE
.LP
an entry in
.B /etc/services
like:
.RS
.HP
cns           56013/tcp                        # CASTOR user privilege

The user privilege database keeps the information: uid, gid, source host, target host, privilege.
.LP
The user privilege configuration file contains password information for the
database and must be readable/writable only by root.
It contains a single line in the format:
.RS
.HP
username/password@server
.RE
where 'username' and 'password' are the credentials to login to the database
instance identified by 'server'.
