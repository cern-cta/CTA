The CASTOR 2 software is the latest evolution of the CERN hierarchical mass storage
system for high availability data. CASTOR 2 was brought
into production in early 2006 and has already successfully passed 
several data challenges, showing its ability to sustain constant loads
of over 4~GB/s, to store tens of millions of files using more than 7~PB of
total space and to serve concurrently more than 5000 file transfers.
CASTOR 2 comes with extensive monitoring tools in an extensible framework
allowing service managers to easily monitor the system and improve operations.

CASTOR 2 integrates with the Grid framework by implementing an SRM interface.
Specification 1.1 has been implemented and is in production, specification 2.2
is currently undergoing tests prior to its deployment \cite{srmmsst07}. Future evolutions of 
the specification will be supported.

Other future developments include improvements of the
authentication and authorization scheme via the
use of the VOMS (Virtual Organization Membership Service) Grid standard\cite{VOMS}.
Better support for disk only data pools (where no tape backup is used),
improvements in efficiency of the disk and tape usage and extension of monitoring
functionalities to support Grid accounting are also planned.
