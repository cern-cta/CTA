The code in this directory is a very basic infrastructure to run stress tests;
it has been written having in mind running performance tests against the Castor name server.
However, it can be changed to run any stress test in multithreaded mode.

To use it you need to edit the TestThread.cpp class and write anything you want to stress test.
The example in CVS already contains code for different tests, including stats, file creations
and unlinks, getpath, etc.

To compile the code:
--------------------

g++ -fPIC -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -Wall -Wno-long-long  -g -O0 -pedantic -I ../../h -I ../.. -pthread -DCTHREAD_POSIX -D_THREAD_SAFE -D_REENTRANT -c -o TestThread.o TestThread.cpp
g++ -fPIC -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -Wall -Wno-long-long  -g -O0 -pedantic -I ../../h -I ../.. -pthread -DCTHREAD_POSIX -D_THREAD_SAFE -D_REENTRANT -c -o TestMTServer.o TestMTServer.cpp
g++ -o nstest -g -O0 -pthread TestThread.o TestMTServer.o -L ../../shlib -lnsl -ldl -lshift -Wl,-rpath-link,../../shlib

To run it:
----------
Start it with:
./nstest -T <n>
This will run <n> threads of your code in background; as for the Castor daemons, -f will run it in foreground.

Then stop it with:
killall nstest
The signal handler will stop the test and overall statistics will be gathered and printed.
