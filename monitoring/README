Castor2 Monitoring

This directory contains the sql scripts necessary for the castor2 
monitoring package. 

./setup
Setup scripts for the stager account. tablesetup.sql should be run under 
the stager account in oracle and will create the necessary monitoring 
tables and install/overwrite procedures.

./tasks
Setup script for the read account. This must be run *after* the 
tablesetup.sql script. Creates oracle tasks and creates initial data in 
the monitoring tables.

./cleanup
cleanread.sql removes all castor2 monitoring tasks in the 
read account.
cleanstager.sql removes all castor2 monitoring tables and procedures in 
the stager account.

./procedures
sql files for each procedure - it should not be necessary to call these 
individually as they are referenced by tablesetup.sql in ./setup.
