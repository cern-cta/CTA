HOW TO :


*) ADD A METRIC IN THE COCKPIT :

    - write the metric file and put it in "logprocessord/metrics"
    - avoid the words "-lemon" and "-test"  in the name (both file and metric name), as it is used to determine whether a metric is used by the lemon sensor



*) UPDATE COCKPIT RPM : (process not tested yet, but should work fine)

    - update the RPM
    - run in cockpit directory (/var/www/castormon by default) :
        
        $ python manage.py migrate cockpit

    - restart apache :
        
        # /etc/init.d/httpd restart -d



*) ADD A LEMON METRIC :

    - write the metric file for the MAE and put it in "logprocessord/metrics"
    - put "-lemon" at the end of the name (both file and metric names)
    - write the metric class for lemon sensor, using RPyC server (cf sensor)
    - CF http://lemon-monitoring.web.cern.ch/pythonapi
    - test the lemon-sensor with :

        $ python /usr/libexec/sensors/lemon-sensor.py sensor-example

    - see lemon guy for informations on release
