/*
 * Alert messages can be anything you want them to be. The SSI framework enforces
 * the following rules:
 *
 * - alerts are sent in the order posted,
 * - all outstanding alerts are sent before the final response is sent (i.e. the one
 * posted using a SetResponse() method),
 * - once a final response is posted, subsequent alert messages are not sent, and
 * - if a request is cancelled, all pending alerts are discarded.
 *
 * In order to send an alert, you must encapsulate your message using an
 * XrdSsiRespInfoMsg object. The object provides synchronization between posting
 * an alert, sending the alert, and releasing storage after the alert was sent. It is defined
 * in the XrdSsiRespInfo.hh header file.
 *
 * The XrdSsiRespInfoMsg object needs to be inherited by whatever class you use to
 * manage your alert message. The pure abstract class, RecycleMsg() must also be
 * implemented. This method is called after the message is sent or when it is discarded.
 * A parameter to the method tells you why itâ€™s being called.
 *
 * See example p.45
