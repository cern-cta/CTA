# DESCRIPTION
#
#   - This tests exists to make sure that tape-enabled files with no tape copy
#   cannot be evicted from disk.
#
# EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR
#
#   # The following steps will be carried:
#
#   1. Put the destination tape drives down.
#   2. Write a file to EOSCTA for archiving.
#   3. Execute eos root://MGM_HOST stagerrm PATH.
#   4. Test the exit code of the command is failure.
#   5. Test the disk replica still exists.
#   6. Execute xrdfs MGM_HOST prepare -e PATH.
#   7. Test the exit code of the command is failure.
#   8. Test the disk replica still exists.
#   9. Put the destination tape drives up.
#   10. Test the file is successfully archived to tape.
