# How to update the EOS version used in CI

1. ssh to **aiadm**, then:
```
$ cd /eos/user/c/ctareg/www/cta-ci-repo/
$ cp <path_to_rpms>/eos-*.rpm eos/x86_64/
$ ./update_repos.sh
```
2. In the CTA repository, update the yum version lock list with the new EOS version:
```
/CTA/continuousintegration/docker/ctafrontend/cc7/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/versionlock.list
```
