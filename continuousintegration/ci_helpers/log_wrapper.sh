# This script can be sourced in any other script and will prepend ALL output of stdout and stderror with the corresponding log prefix
# This will only happen if the BASH_LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable is explicitly set to true


# Note that these functions are not meant to be used directly outside of this script; just use echo (and redirect to stderr if necessary)
# The reason is twofold: first the existing file descriptor redirection will cause it two prepend twice.
# Second, it hurts the portability of the script that sources this, and does not make it as easy to turn off logging.
