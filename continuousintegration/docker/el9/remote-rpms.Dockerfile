# As a result, any installs on this image will also pull from public yum repos instead of private ones

# yum.repos.d-public, as this might overwrite an existing CTA repo when installing cta-release
# If we were to put it in yum.repos.d-internal, we would have to manually copy it from internal
# even if we want the public repos, which is not nice.
