# where do we want to get xroot from?
# epel version is more recent but eos-citrine-depend repo has a higher priority (4) than epel
# => need to set epel prio to 4: yum-config-manager --setopt="epel.priority=4"
# or if taking the older version from eos, eos-citrine-depend must be enabled so that
# the older version of xroot is installed by cta-cli and is not conflicting later when installing eos...
# Newer version of CTA requires xroot >= 4.4.1-1...
# therefore set epel priority to 4...
# Create local repo for cta artifacts and to cache RPMs locally


# Populate local repository and enable it, then install any rpm that is needed for
# any container. Finally add needed directories.
