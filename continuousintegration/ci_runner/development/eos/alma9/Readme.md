### How to use

#### 1. Build the docker image

This script will build the docker image that can be used for EOS development:

```bash
./prepare_eosdev_image.sh [<eos_version>]
```
The `<eos_version>` is the version of EOS to get the dependencies from. It can be a commit, branch or a tag. \
If not defined, `<eos_version>` will default to `master`. However, for EOS development, it's recommended to use a tagged commit instead of `master` (it's guaranteed to be more stable).

#### 2. Run the docker image

To list the latest built images, run:
```bash
podman images
```

To launch one of them (detached), proceed with:
```bash
./start_ctadev.sh [-p <port>] [-v <mount>] <image>
```

The `<port>` parameter can be used to forward port `<port>` on the localhost to port `22` on the container. This can be used by ssh clients to access the container through a network. \
The `<mount>` parameter can be used to mount a local directory to the container directory `/shared`.
The `<image>` is the image of the container that we want to run.

##### 2.1 Setup `ssh` server

By default, the image comes with `openssh-server` installed and running. \
In order to accept SSH connections, we need to upload a public key to the container.

Example:
```bash
# Do not upload private key!
podman cp <id_rsa_or_other.pub> <container_id>:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

And also open the port `<port>` on the host:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=<port>/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

With this completed, accessing the container is simple:
```bash
# Access the container on host <hostname> and port <port>
ssh -p <port> root@<hostname>
```

#### 3. Build EOS

Once inside the container, building EOS is simple!
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/dss/eos.git
cd eos/
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir ../eos_build
cd ../eos_build
cmake3 ../eos
make -j 4
```

To validate that CTA was build correctly, run the unit tests inside `eos_build`:
```bash
# We need to set the EOS libraries path, unless we have installed them
cd eos_build
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$(pwd)/common:$(pwd)/mq
# Run the tests
cd unit_tests/
./eos-unit-tests
```

##### 3.1. Build EOS RPMs

Building the RPMs follows a similar procedure:
```bash
mkdir eos_rpm
cd eos_rpm
cmake3 ../eos
make rpm
```

In order to make the RPMs available to the host dev machine, copy them to the `shared` directory (mounted volume):
```bash
cp eos_rpm/RPMS/x86_64/* /shared/
```

#### 4. Other notes

For EOS development it's best to modify the files in the same development development environment where they are build (ie. do both changes and build inside the container). Developing on a local machine, and synching the files to be built on a remote host will probably lead to build issues.
