/******************************************************************************
 * The following code deals with automatic prerequisites, that is with        *
 * automatic generation of the list of header files that a given source file  * 
 * depends on and with automatic validation that these files did not change   *
 * when one checks whether to recompile the given source file.                *
 * The ideas behind this code are taken from the GNU make manual (see chapter *
 * "Generating Prerequisites Automatically") and from the article found at    *
 * http://locklessinc.com/articles/makefile_tricks/                           *
 * Nevertheless, the code is explained in deep details in the comment         *
 ******************************************************************************/

/*
 * This first macro is able to build a piece of Makefile that expresses the
 * list of dependencies of a given file. It is based on the gcc -MM
 * functionnality plus a couple of refinements.
 *
 *   The basic functionnality is to call gcc -MM on the input file ("$<") and
 * store the result in an output file ("> $@" at the end). As you guessed, this
 * macro is actually supposed to be used in a rule like this :
 * %.d : %.c
 *      $(create_d)
 * And it will thus generate the .d file out of the .c one.
 *   As gcc -MM is able to dig out all the non-system dependencies of a file and
 * create a piece of Makefile, the .d file will look like this :
 * BaseAddress.o : BaseAddress.cpp \
 *  /home/sponcec3/DEVEL/trunk/castor/BaseAddress.hpp \
 *  /home/sponcec3/DEVEL/trunk/castor/IAddress.hpp
 *
 *   However, the default output of gcc -MM misses the dependencies of the .d
 * file itself (which are the same as for the .o). Thus the .d file would not
 * be rebuilt if any dependency has changed. This is why we pipe the output of
 * gcc -MM into a sed expression. Let's detail this expression :
 *   - H means "Copy/append pattern space to hold space." (see sed man page)
 *   - at the end of the file the ${} regexp triggers. (Note the dollar sign
 *     needs to be escaped into two dollar signed due to it running within make
 *   - g means "Copy/append hold space to pattern space." (see sed man page)
 *   - s,....,; is a replacement expression where , is used as separator. We
 *     cannot use the regular / as files names will appear in place of $* and $@
 *   - p means "Print the current pattern space." (see sed man page). It goes
 * together with the -n flag that disables the default printing of pattern space.
 * The H/g trick is needed in order to deal with the multiline output of gcc -M
 * The final content of the .d file looks like this :
 * BaseAddress.o BaseAddress.d : BaseAddress.cpp \
 *  /home/sponcec3/DEVEL/trunk/castor/BaseAddress.hpp \
 *  /home/sponcec3/DEVEL/trunk/castor/IAddress.hpp

/*
 * this rules use the create_d macro to build dependency files from source files.
 * Another rule is needed to make the compiled files depend on the dependency
 * file on top of the source file itself. This is achieved by using "Static
 * Pattern Rules" (see GNU make manual) generated by imake from the
 * BareSharedLibraryTarget and ProgramTarget that look like :
 * objects: %.o: %.d
 * They make all targets of the objects list depend on their coresponding .d file

/*
 * The last part is to include the generated dependency files into this
 * Makefile. This is done via the include directive.
 * Note that this step is less trivial than it seems : we do not include
 * explicit files here, but only existing dependency files. Typically, none
 * on the first compilation of a clean repository.
 * However, if no dependency file has been built so far, then we know that
 * no compilation took place so far, thus the compilation will take place now
 * and we do not need to check the dependencies to trigger it.
 * Note also that a simpler approach would have been to include all .d files
 * explicitely (using imake macros). However, the arguments to include are
 * considered as targets by the Makefile. Thus in this approach, all .d
 * files would be checked and built if necessary for each call to make,
 * even if you called make clean for example.
