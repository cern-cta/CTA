     The staging facilities offer fast access to  tape  data  via
     copies  in  a  disk  pool.   A stage daemon manages the pool
     space and keeps a catalog of staged files.  A disk pool con-
     sists in a number of file systems distributed over different
     machines.  It can be private to  an  experiment  or  public.
     Use  mmmmaaaannnn  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  for details of the commands recognized by
     the stager:

     stagealloc     allocate space in a disk pool

     stagecat       put an entry in the stage daemon catalog  for
                    an existing file (admin only)

     stageclr       remove staged files

     stageget       find file  allocated  in  a  disk  pool  with
                    ssssttttaaaaggggeeeeaaaalllllllloooocccc.

     stagein        allocate space in a disk pool and copy  files
                    from tape to disk or from disk to disk

     stageinit      tell stgdaemon to reread the pool  configura-
                    tion file (admin only)

     stageout       allocate space and store the option values in
                    the  stgdaemon  catalog  for  use by stageput
                    later

     stageput       copy disk files to tape. It can only be  used
                    for a file allocated with stageout

     stageqry       give the status of all staged tapes

     stageupdc      update the stager catalog
