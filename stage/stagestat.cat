     ssssttttaaaaggggeeeessssttttaaaatttt obtains information on the usage of  a  stager  by
     reading the ssssaaaacccccccctttt accounting file.  The information is given
     in tabular form in two sections.

     The first section gives global statistics  for  the  stager,
     which  consists of details on each stage command such as the
     number of requests, number of successful requests,  warnings
     and  errors.  Also the number of mounts, remounts, multifile
     requests and mounts avoided by the stager.

     The second section gives file details by pool name,  includ-
     ing  average lifetime per file and per group if garbage col-
     lected, and average number of  accesses  per  file  and  per
     group.
