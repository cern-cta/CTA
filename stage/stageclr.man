.SH DESCRIPTION
.B stageclr
removes staged files from disk if the requestor is in the same group as the
user who created the disk file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c
conditional clear. If this option is specified the remove operation is done
only if the free space in the pool is lower than a minimum.
This minimum may be specified thru the option
.BR \-m .
.TP
.BI \-F
Forces request to be deleted - admin user only except when used with with \-M option, for which deletion in the HSM is forced and done under requestor uid/gid.
.TP
.BI \-h " host"
Sends the request to the stager on
.IR host .
This may also be specified thru the environment variable STAGE_HOST.
.TP
.BI \-I " external_filename"
clears in the catalog the entry corresponding to this external disk file and
remove the staged file from the pool.
.TP
.BI \-i
the list of pathnames to be removed is read from
.IR stdin .
If the operation fails on a path,
.B stageclr
continues with the next path in the list and the global exit code corresponds
to the first failure.
.TP
.BI \-L " link_name"
gives the pathname of the user link to be removed. The data file is not
removed.
.TP
.BI \-l " label_type"
Label type:
.BR al ,
.BR nl ,
.B sl
or
.BR blp .
.TP
.BI \-M " hsmfile"
clears in the stager catalog the entry corresponding to this HSM file and
remove the staged file from the pool, but it does not remove the file from
the Hierarchical Storage Management System.
This operation should be explicitely requested with the option
.BR \-remove_from_hsm .
.TP
.BI \-m " minfree"
specifies the minimum free space to be available in the pool.
This is a percentage.
For example,
.B \-m 10
corresponds to 10% of free space.
The default minfree value is taken from the configuration file
.B /etc/STGCONFIG.
.TP
.BI \-P " pathname"
gives the path name of the file to be purged,
either full internal name or user link name.
.TP
.BI \-p " poolname"
restricts the action to a given pool.
.TP
.BI \-q " file_sequence_number(s)"
restricts the action to tape files having this given sequence number.
The option value is considered as a single file sequence (case of concatenation).
It is exclusive with \-Q option.
.TP
.BI \-Q " file_sequence_range"
restricts the action to tape files having the sequence numbers within the given range.
Multiple file numbers may be separated by commas or specified as a range
using the dash as separator.
It is exclusive with \-q option.
.TP
.BI \-\-nodisk
Prevent stager daemon to do disk access. The entry is removed from the catalog, but stager do not attempt to remove it physically. Thus space knowledge of the corresponding filesystem is unchanged.
.TP
.BI \-remove_from_hsm
to remove the file from the Hierarchical Storage Management System as well.
.TP
.BI \-\-reqid " reqid"
to remove only entry that has this explicit request ID.
.TP
.BI \-V " vid(s)"
restricts the search to files corresponding to given vids.
Multiple vids will be separated by colons.
.\" .TP
.\" .B \-\-side "sidenumber"
.\" Tells which side of the device you refer to (applies to multi-side medias files yet in the disk pool, like DVD). Only when used with
.\" .B \-V
.\" option.
.SH RETURN CODES
\
.br
0	Ok.
.br
1	Bad parameter.
.br
2	System error.
.br
4	Configuration error.
