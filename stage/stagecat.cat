     entry in the catalog for an already existing data _f_i_l_e.

     _f_i_l_e may be a local path, the  combination  _m_a_c_h_i_n_e:_f_u_l_l_p_a_t_h
     (NFS syntax) or a full path starting with the NFS_ROOT, i.e.

          The data was converted from this character set when  it

     ----FFFF _r_e_c_f_m
          Specifies the record format of the data on the tape. It
          may be one of the following:

          UUUU,,,,ffff77777777
               Blocks may be of unknown length. A single  logical
               record  on disk corresponds to one tape block. The
               disk copy of the file is  formatted  according  to
               the  convention for sequential FORTRAN unformatted
               I/O.

          UUUU    is an alias for UUUU,,,,ffff77777777.

          UUUU,,,,bbbbiiiinnnn
               Blocks may be of unknown length.  This  format  is
               suitable  for  use  with  files  created by direct
               access Fortran unformatted I/O or C I/O.

          FFFF    Each tape block is exactly  _b_l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e  bytes  long
               (See the -b option) with the exception of the last
               block which may be shorter.  _l_r_e_c_l must be  speci-
               fied  (-L  option) and if both _b_l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e and _l_r_e_c_l
               are provided, they should be equal.
               Data was copied from tape to disk as a  continuous
               data stream.  This format is suitable for use with
               direct access Fortran unformatted I/O or C I/O.

          FFFFBBBB   This allows to  group  several  records  of  _l_r_e_c_l
               bytes  into tape blocks of _b_l_k_s_i_z_e bytes.  _b_l_k_s_i_z_e
               must be a multiple of _l_r_e_c_l.

          The default record format is UUUU.

     ----ffff _f_i_d
          Specifies the fileid in HDR1. If more than  17  charac-
          ters  long, only the last 17 are taken. It is then con-
          verted to upper case.

     ----GGGG    Specifies that the tape copy operations was issued  on
          the tape server by the 'group user'. A 'group user' may
          be defined for each group in ////eeeettttcccc////sssshhhhiiiifffftttt....ccccoooonnnnffff....
          For example:
               GRPUSER ws     opalprod

     ----gggg _d_g_n
          The tape volume belongs to device group _d_g_n.   It  must
          match the device group specified in TMS (if installed).
          If this parameter is missing, the value is  taken  from
          TMS or defaults to CART.

     ----hhhh _h_o_s_t
          Sends the request to the stager on _h_o_s_t.  This may also

          onto _f_i_l_e.

     ----LLLL _l_r_e_c_l
          Specifies the logical record length  for  fixed  length
          record format files.

     ----llll _l_a_b__t_y_p_e
          Specifies the type of labelwhich was used when  copying
          the data from tape.  The following label types are sup-
          ported:

          aaaallll   ANSI label

          bbbbllllpppp  bypass label processing

          nnnnllll   no label

          ssssllll   standard IBM label

          It must match the  label  type  specified  in  TMS  (if
          installed).  If this parameter is missing, the value is
          taken from TMS or defaults to ssssllll.

     ----NNNN _n_r_e_a_d
          If specified, the number  of  records  was  limited  to
          _n_r_e_a_d when the data was copied from tape to disk.

     ----pppp _p_o_o_l_n_a_m_e
          The file resides in the pool _p_o_o_l_n_a_m_e.  This  may  also
          be specified thru the environment variable STAGE_POOL.

     ----qqqq _f_s_e_q
          Specifies the  file  sequence  number(s)  of  the  tape
          file(s) which were copied onto that disk file.  Default
          is 1.  Multiple files may be specified using  the  fol-
          lowing syntax:

          _f_1-_f_2           Files _f_1 to _f_2 inclusive.

          _f_1-             Files _f_1 to the last file on the tape.

          _f_1-_f_2,_f_4,_f_6-    A series of non-consecutive  ranges  of
                         files.

     ----SSSS _s_e_r_v_e_r
          Specifies that the tape copy operation was executed  on
          the tape server _s_e_r_v_e_r.

     ----ssss _s_i_z_e
          If specified, the number of Mbytes was limited to  _s_i_z_e
          when  the data was copied from tape to disk.  The value
          must be smaller than 2048 (2 Gbytes).

     ----VVVV _v_i_d
          Specifies the tape VID if different from the VSN  .  In
          the  case of multi-volume files a series of _v_i_ds may be
          given, separated by ":"s, in the  order  in  which  the
          tapes are to be used.

     ----vvvv _v_s_n

          given, separated by ":"s, in the  order  in  which  the
