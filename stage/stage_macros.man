.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstage macros\fP are utilities to determine in which state is a given
.BI stcp
record.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 2.0i
.BI stcp
Pointer to a stcp_entry structure

.SH MACROS
.TP 2.0i
.BI ISSTAGED
Will return true if the file is on disk and staged (e.g. successfully recalled or successfully migrated)
.TP
.BI ISPUT_FAILED
Will return true if the migration of this file failed
.TP
.BI ISSTAGEIN
Will return true if the file is being staged on disk
.TP
.BI ISSTAGEOUT
Will return true if the disk file is being writen to
.TP
.BI ISSTAGEWRT
Will return true if the file is being migrated. This is typical with internal migrator in case of CASTOR files.
.TP
.BI ISSTAGEPUT
Will return true if the file is being explicitely migrated. This reflect a mode that is discouraged (stagewrt is preferred)
.TP
.BI ISSTAGEALLOC
Will return true if the file was allocated on disk, possibly filled by its owner.
.TP
.BI ISWAITING
Will return true if the file is waiting for space (allocation problem), or on another request (case of two stageins on the same file), waiting to be migrated or waiting to be created in the name server (only for CASTOR files - the lifetime of this state is usually very short)
.TP
.BI ISCASTOR
Will return true if the file of CASTOR HSM type
.TP
.BI ISCASTORMIG
Will return true if the file is a CASTOR HSM one, candidate for migration, waiting for migration or being migrated
.TP
.BI ISCASTORBEINGMIG
Will return true if the file is a CASTOR HSM one, being migrated (via the internal migrator or explicitely)
.TP
.BI ISCASTORCANBEMIG
Will return true if the file is a CASTOR HSM one, candidate for migration, but only this.
.TP
.BI ISCASTORWAITINGNS
Will return true if the file is a CASTOR HSM one, waiting to be created in the CASTOR Name Server (this state usually is not visible, its existence might reveal a problem)
.TP
.BI ISCASTORWAITINGMIG
Will return true if the file is a CASTOR HSM one, waiting to be migrated (this state is possible only when the internal migrator is in action, but in an intermediate state)

.SH RETURN VALUE
All the macros return true on success.
