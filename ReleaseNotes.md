- eos-4.6.8 which brings the delete on close feature

## Upgrade Instructions from v1.0-3

### 1. Upgrade the Catalogue schema version from version 1.0 to 1.1

Before updating CTA, the Catalogue schema should be upgraded. Here is the link to the documentation about the database schema updating procedure : [https://eoscta.docs.cern.ch/catalogue/upgrade/](https://eoscta.docs.cern.ch/catalogue/upgrade/)

The liquibase changeLog file is already done so you can directly run the [*liquibase update*](https://eoscta.docs.cern.ch/catalogue/upgrade/backward_compatible_upgrades/#3-run-the-liquibase-updatesql-command) command with the changeLogFile located in the directory *CTA/catalogue/migrations/liquibase/oracle/1.0to1.1.sql*.

### 2. Update CTA components

TODO : Instructions about how to update the tapeservers and the frontend.
