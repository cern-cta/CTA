 * This is a na√Øve implementation, where memory is allocated and deallocated on every use. It favours
 * computation efficiency over memory efficiency: the buffer allocated is twice the hint size, but data
 * copying is minimized.
 *
 * A more performant implementation could be implemented using a buffer pool, using the Recycle()
 * method to return buffers to the pool.
