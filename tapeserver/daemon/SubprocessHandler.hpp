/** 
 * The interface to classes managing subprocesses. It allows an external loop
 * to handle global polling and timeouts for a set of them. Several children
 * classes are expected to be developed: a DriveHandler, a MaintenanceHandler 
 * and a SignalHandler (using signalfd()).
 * The main loop will typically be:
 * statuses[] = [all]->getInitialStatus(); // This implicitly registers the right fds in epoll (if needed)
 * loop forever
 *   if statuses[any].shutdownRequested
 *     [all]->shutdown()
 *   if statuses[all].completedShutdown()
 *     exit;
 *   if statuses[any].killRequested
 *     [all]->kill()
 *     exit;
 *   if statuses[any].forkRequested()
 *     [all]->prepareToFork()
 *     if [requester]->fork() == child
 *        exit([requester]->runChild())
 *     else
 *        statuses[] = [all]->postFork()
 *   Compute the next timeout statuses[all].timeToTimeout
 *   epoll()
 * 
 * This loop allows cooperative preparation for forking, and cleanup after the 
 * fork. This could be as simple as a pre-fork noop and a closing of child
 * communication sockets post fork (child side).
 * TODO: post-fork is not yet implemented.
