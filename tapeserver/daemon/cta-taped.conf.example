#

# The user of the cta-taped daemon process

# taped LogFormat default
#
#
# Path to the CTA Catalogue configuration file
# taped CatalogueConfigFile /etc/cta/cta-catalogue.conf
#
# URL of the objectstore (CTA Scheduler Database). Usually this will be the URL of a Ceph RADOS
# objectstore. For testing or small installations, a file-based objectstore can be used instead.
ObjectStore BackendPath rados://cta@tapecta:cta
# ObjectStore BackendPath /path/to/local/objectstore

#
# DRIVE OPTIONS
#
# The name of the drive. Will be included for every line in the logs. This can help identifying
# a problematic maintenance process of the drive after log agregation.
# taped DriveName
#
# CTA's logical library the tape drive will be linked to.
# taped DriveLogicalLibrary
#
# Path to the character special device used to access the drive.
# taped DriveDevice
#
# The SCSI media changer address of the drive. This is "smc" + the drive ordinal number of the
# device, which can be obtained with "cta-smc -q D"
# taped DriveControlPath

#
# GENERAL OPTIONS
# This options will be included in every log line of the tape daemon to enhance log identification
# when swapping drives between different backends.
#
# Unique string to identify CTA's instance the tape daemon is serving (i.e: production, preproduction).
# Each of these instances should be associated with a specific CTA catalogue instance.
# general InstanceName production
#
# The unique string to identify the backend scheduler resources. As an example, it can be structured as:
# "[ceph|postgres|vfs][User|Repack]".
# general SchedulerBackendName cephUser

#
# MEMORY MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
#

# Number of memory buffers per drive in the data transfer cache. This value should be configured
# according to the physical memory available.
# taped BufferCount 5000

# Size of one memory buffer in the data transfer cache, in bytes. Default is 5 MB.
# taped BufferSizeBytes 5000000

#
# BATCHED METADATA ACCESS AND TAPE WRITE FLUSH OPTIONS
#

# Maximum batch size for processing archive requests, specified as a tuple (number of bytes, number of
# files). Defaults to 80 GB and 4000 files.
# taped ArchiveFetchBytesFiles 80000000000,4000
# 
# Flush  to tape criteria. During archiving operations, this parameter defines the maximum number of
# bytes and number of files that will be written to tape before a flush to # tape (synchronised tape
# mark). Defaults to 32 GB and 200 files.
# taped ArchiveFlushBytesFiles 32000000000,200
# 
# Maximum batch size for processing retrieve requests, specified as a tuple (number of bytes, number of
# files). When cta-taped fetches a batch of retrieve requests, the batch cannot exceed the number of
# bytes and number of files specified by this parameter. Defaults to 80 GB and 4000 files.
# taped RetrieveFetchBytesFiles 80000000000,4000

#
# SCHEDULING OPTIONS
#

# Criteria to mount a tape, specified as a tuple (number of bytes, number of files). An archival or
# retrieval queue must contain at least this number of bytes or this number of files before a tape mount
# will be triggered. This does not apply when the timeout specified in the applicable mount rule is
# exceeded. Defaults to 500 GB and 10000 files.
# taped MountCriteria 500000000000,10000

#
# TAPED CACHE TIMEOUT OPTIONS
#
# Defaults to 600 seconds if not set.
# taped TapeCacheMaxAgeSecs 600
#
# Defaults to 10 seconds if not set.
# taped RetrieveQueueCacheMaxAgeSecs 10

#
# DISK FILE ACCESS OPTIONS
#

# The number of disk I/O threads. This determines the maximum number of parallel file transfers.
# taped NbDiskThreads 10

#
# TAPE ENCRYPTION SUPPORT
#

# Enable tape hardware encryption. Encryption will be enabled only for tapes where a valid encryption
# key has been configured for the tape or tape pool.
# taped UseEncryption yes
# 
# Path to the external script used to obtain encryption keys.
taped externalEncryptionKeyScript /usr/local/bin/cta-get-encryption-key.sh

#
# LOGICAL BLOCK PROTECTION (LBP) SUPPORT
#

# Force the use of LBP is the drive supports it. Defaults to 'yes' if not set.
# taped UseLBP yes

# 
# DISK SPACE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
#

# Path to the external script used to determine free disk space in the retrieve buffer.
taped externalFreeDiskSpaceScript /usr/bin/cta-eosdf.sh

#
# RECOMMENDED ACCESS ORDER (RAO) OPTIONS
#
#

# ##### WARNING #####
#
# The default RAO options should provide the best retrieve performance out of the box. These options
# should only be changed by expert users for specific tests.
#
# ##### WARNING #####

# Enable Recommended Access Order (RAO) if available. This setting is used to enable both hardware
# and software RAO for all drives that support it. Hardware RAO in IBM Enterprise and LTO drives
# generation 9 or later needs no further configuration. The additional RAO options below are for
# software RAO on LTO-8 drives.
# taped UseRAO yes
# 
# On LTO-8 tape drives, specify which software RAO algorithm to use. Valid options are linear,
# random, sltf. This should be set to sltf in production environments.
# taped RAOLTOAlgorithm sltf
# 
# Specify options for the software RAO algorithm.
# taped RAOLTOAlgorithmOptions cost_heuristic_name:cta

#
# MAINTENANCE PROCESS CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
#

# ##### WARNING #####
#
# The CTA secheduler is fully distributed. By default, all cta-taped processes will handle reporting
# jobs and repack requests. These values should only be changed by expert users. Misconfiguration can
# stop CTA from functioning.
#
# ##### WARNING #####

# Enable RepackRequestManager for repack-related operations.
# taped UseRepackManagement yes
# 
# Enable MaintenanceProcess for repack-related operations, garbage collection and disk reporting.

#

# The default TCP/IP port on which the CASTOR rmcd daemon listens for incoming\
# TCP/IP connections from the tape server.
