# NAME

cta-readtp --- Low-level utility to read files from a tape

# SYNOPSIS

**cta-readtp** *vid* *sequence* \[\--destination\_files *file_url*] \[\--drive *drive_name*] \[\--help]

# DESCRIPTION

**cta-readtp** is a command-line tool for reading files from tape and
validating their checksums.

The tape to be read is specified by the *vid* argument. The tape files
to be read are specified as a *sequence* of tape file sequence numbers.
The syntax used to specify the sequence is as follows:

    f1-f2         Files f1 to f2 inclusive.
    f1-           Files f1 to the last file on the tape.
    f1-f2,f4,f6-  A series of non-consecutive ranges of files.

# OPTIONS

-f, \--destination\_files *file_url*

:   Path to a file containing a list of destination URLs that the files
    will be written to (one URL per line). If not specified, all data
    read will be written to */dev/null*. If there are less destination
    files than read files, the remaining files read will be written to
    */dev/null*.

-u, \--drive *drive_name*

:   The unit name of the drive used. Defaults to the first taped
    configuration file matching *cta-taped-unitName.conf* under the
    directory */etc/cta/*.

-h, \--help

:   Display command options and exit.

# EXIT STATUS

**cta-readtp** returns 0 on success.
