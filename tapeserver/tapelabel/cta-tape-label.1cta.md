# NAME

cta-tape-label --- Pre-label a CTA tape

# SYNOPSIS

**cta-tape-label** \[\--oldlabel *old_vid*] \[\--loadtimeout *timeout*] \[\--drive *drive_name*] \[\--force] \[\--help] \[\--debug] \--vid *vid*

# DESCRIPTION

**cta-tape-label** writes the CTA label file **VOL1** at the beginning
of a tape, to prepare the tape to store data files. The label contains
the Volume ID specified by *vid*.

If the tape to be labelled already contains files, running **cta-tape-label**
is a destructive operation, which writes the label file to the beginning
of tape and renders all data beyond the label file inaccessible.

For non-blank tapes, **cta-tape-label** checks that the *vid* supplied
matches the existing label of the tape in the drive. This behaviour can
be changed with the \--oldlabel and \--force options (see **OPTIONS**, below).

# OPTIONS

-o, \--oldlabel *old_vid*

:   The Volume ID (VID) of the current label on the tape, if it is not
    the same as *vid* and the tape is not blank.

-t, \--loadtimeout *timeout*

:   The timeout to load the tape in the drive slot, in seconds. Defaults
    to 7200 (two hours), to allow time for media initialisation.

-u, \--drive *drive_name*

:   The unit name of the drive used. Defaults to the first taped
    configuration file matching *cta-taped-unitName.conf* under the
    directory */etc/cta/*.

-f, \--force

:   **Warning: this option destroys any data on the tape without first
    performing the label check.**

    Force labelling for non-blank tapes. This is intended for testing or
    use in rare situations by expert operators. This option should not be
    used when calling **cta-tape-label** from a script.

-h, \--help

:   Display command options and exit.

-d, \--debug

:   Verbose log messages.

# EXIT STATUS

**cta-tape-label** returns 0 on success.

# EXAMPLES

cta-tape-label \--vid I54321 \--oldvid T12345 \--debug

cta-tape-label \--vid L54321 \--force
