.SH NAME
cta-taped \- Tape server daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "cta-taped [OPTIONS]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcta-taped\fP is the daemon responsible for controlling one or more tape
drives.
.P
When \fBcta-taped\fP is executed it immediately forks with the parent
terminating and the child running in the background.  If required the
\fB\-f, \-\-foreground\fP option can be used to stop \fBcta-taped\fP from
forking and keep the parent process in the foreground.

.SH TAPE LIBRARY SUPPORT

CTA supports two types of tape libraries, SCSI compatible ones and Oracle
Automatic Cartridge System (ACS) ones.  The cta-taped daemon requires a tape
library daemon to be installed and run on the same tape server as itself.
There are two types of CTA tape library daemons, one for SCSI compatible tape
libraries and one for ACS tape libraries.

A SCSI compatible tape library requires the following daemon:

\fBrmcd\fP

The installation RPM for the \fBrmcd\fP daemon and its manual page is:

\fBcta-rmcd-MAJORVERSION-MINORVERSION.el7.cern.x86_64.rpm\fP

The \fBcta-rmcd\fP daemon can be started, stopped and its status queried using
the usual service commands:

\fBservice cta-rmcd start\fP
.br
\fBservice cta-rmcd status\fP
.br
\fBservice cta-rmcd stop\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-f, \-\-foreground
Remain in the foreground.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help
Prints the usage message.
.TP
\fB\-c, \-\-config <config-file>
Set the location of the CTA configuration file (cta-taped.conf).  The default location is /etc/cta/cta-taped.conf.

.SH CTA CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
The cta-taped daemon reads and uses the following CTA configuration
parameters which are specified within the CTA configuration file (the
default location is /etc/cta/cta-tapd.conf).

.TP
\fBRMC MAXRQSTATTEMPTS
Maximum number of attempts a retriable RMC request should be issued.

.TP
\fBtaped BlkMoveTimeout
The maximum time in seconds the data-transfer session of tapeserverd can
cease to move data blocks

.TP
\fBtaped BufferCount
Number of memory buffers in the data-transfer cache.

.TP
\fBtaped BufferSizeBytes
Size of a memory buffer in the data-transfer cache in bytes (default is 5
Mebibytes).

.TP
\fBtaped BulkRequestMigrationMaxBytes
When the tapeserverd daemon requests the tapegatewayd daemon for a set of
files to migrate to tape, this parameter defines the maximum number of bytes
the set of files should represent.

.TP
\fBtaped BulkRequestMigrationMaxFiles
When the tapeserverd daemon requests the tapegatewayd daemon for a set of
files to migrate to tape, this parameter defines the maximum number of files
the set may contain.

.TP
\fBtaped BulkRequestRecallMaxBytes
When the tapeserverd daemon requests the tapegatewayd daemon for a set of
files to recall from tape, this parameter defines the maximum number of bytes
the set of files should represent.

.TP
\fBtaped BulkRequestRecallMaxFiles
When the tapeserverd daemon requests the tapegatewayd daemon for a set of
files to recall from tape, this parameter defines the maximum number of files
the set may contain.

.TP
\fBtaped MaxBytesBeforeFlush
The value of this parameter defines the maximum number of bytes to be written
to tape before a flush to tape (synchronised tape-mark).  Please note that a
flush occurs on a file boundary therefore more bytes will normally be written
to tape before the actual flush occurs.

.TP
\fBtaped MaxFilesBeforeFlush
The value of this parameter defines the maximum number of files to be written
to tape before a flush to tape (synchronised or non-immediate tape-mark).

.TP
\fBtaped MountTimeout
The maximum time in seconds that the data-transfer session can take to mount a
tape.

.TP
\fBtaped NbDiskThreads
The number of disk I/O threads.

.TP
\fBtaped externalEncryptionKeyScript
The Python script to interface with the encryption data store.

.TP
\fBtaped TpConfigPath
The path to tape drive configuration file (defaults is /etc/cta/TPCONFIG).

.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/cta/TPCONFIG
The tape drive configuration file.
.TP
.B /etc/cta/cta-taped.conf
The CTA configuration file.
.TP
.B /var/log/cta/cta-taped.log
The tape tapeserver log file.
