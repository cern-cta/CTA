.TH CTA-TAPED "1cta" "2022-06-30" "CTA" "The CERN Tape Archive (CTA)"

.SH NAME
cta-taped \- CTA Tape Server daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcta-taped\fP [\-\-config \fIconfig_file\fR] [\-\-foreground [\-\-stdout]] [\-\-log\-to\-file \fIlog_file\fR]
.br
\fBcta-taped\fP --help

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcta-taped\fP is the daemon responsible for controlling one or more tape drives.
.P
When \fBcta-taped\fP is executed, it immediately forks, with the parent terminating and the child
running in the background. The \fB\-\-foreground\fP option can be used to keep the parent process
running in the foreground.

.SS Tape Library Support

CTA supports SCSI-compatible tape libraries. The \fBcta-taped\fP daemon requires the tape library daemon
(\fBcta-rmcd\fP) to be installed and running on the same server as itself.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-c, \-\-config \fIconfig_file\fR
Read \fBcta\-taped\fP configuration from \fIconfig_file\fR instead of the default, \fI/etc/cta/cta-taped.conf\fR.
.TP
\-f, \-\-foreground
Do not terminate the \fBcta-taped\fP parent process, keep it in the foreground.
.TP
\-h, \-\-help
Display command options and exit.
.TP
\-l, \-\-log\-to\-file <log_file>
Log to a file instead of using syslog.
.TP
\-s, \-\-stdout
Log to standard output instead of using syslog. Requires \-\-foreground.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The \fBcta-taped\fP daemon reads its configuration parameters from the CTA configuration file (by default,
\fI/etc/cta/cta-taped.conf\fR). Each option is listed here with its \fIdefault\fR value.

.SS Tape Server Configuration Options
.TP
.B taped DaemonUserName \fIcta\fR
The user of the \fBcta\-taped\fP daemon process.
.TP
.B taped DaemonGroupName \fItape\fR
The group of the \fBcta\-taped\fP daemon process.
.TP
.B taped LogMask \fIINFO\fR
Logs with a level lower than this value will be masked. Possible values are EMERG, ALERT, CRIT, ERR,
WARNING, NOTICE (USERERR), INFO, DEBUG. USERERR log level is equivalent to NOTICE, because by
convention, CTA uses log level NOTICE for user errors.
.TP
.B taped TpConfigPath \fI/etc/cta/TPCONFIG\fR
Path to the tape drive configuration file. See \fBFILES\fP, below.
.TP
.B taped CatalogueConfigFile \fI/etc/cta/cta-catalogue.conf\fR
Path to the CTA Catalogue configuration file. See \fBFILES\fP, below.
.TP
.B ObjectStore BackendPath \fI(no default)\fR
URL of the objectstore (CTA Scheduler Database). Usually this will be the URL of a Ceph RADOS
objectstore. For testing or small installations, a file-based objectstore can be used instead.
See \fBcta-objectstore-initialize\fP.

.SS Memory management options
.TP
.B taped BufferCount \fI5000\fR
Number of memory buffers per drive in the data transfer cache.
.TP
.B taped BufferSizeBytes \fI5000000\fR
Size of a memory buffer in the data transfer cache, in bytes.

.SS Batched metadata access and tape write flush options
.TP
.B taped ArchiveFetchBytesFiles \fI80000000000\fR,\fI4000\fR
Maximum batch size for processing archive requests, specified as a tuple (number of bytes, number of
files). When \fBcta-taped\fP fetches a batch of archive requests, the batch cannot exceed the number
of bytes and number of files specified by this parameter. Defaults to 80 GB and 4000 files.
.TP
.B taped ArchiveFlushBytesFiles \fI32000000000\fR,\fI200\fR
Flush to tape criteria, specified as a tuple (number of bytes, number of files). During archiving
operations, this parameter defines the maximum number of bytes and number of files that will be
written to tape before a flush to tape (synchronised tape mark). Defaults to 32 GB and 200 files.
.TP
.B taped RetrieveFetchBytesFiles \fI80000000000\fR,\fI4000\fR
Maximum batch size for processing retrieve requests, specified as a tuple (number of bytes, number of
files). When cta-taped fetches a batch of retrieve requests, the batch cannot exceed the number of
bytes and number of files specified by this parameter. Defaults to 80 GB and 4000 files.

.SS Scheduling options
.TP
.B taped MountCriteria \fI500000000000\fR,\fI10000\fR
Criteria to mount a tape, specified as a tuple (number of bytes, number of files). An archival or
retrieval queue must contain at least this number of bytes or this number of files before a tape mount
will be triggered. This does not apply when the timeout specified in the applicable mount rule is
exceeded. Defaults to 500 GB and 10000 files.

.SS Disk file access options
.TP
.B taped NbDiskThreads \fI10\fR
The number of disk I/O threads. This determines the maximum number of parallel file transfers.

.SS Tape encryption support
.TP
.B taped UseEncryption \fIyes\fR
Enable tape hardware encryption. Encryption will be enabled only for tapes where a valid encryption
key has been configured for the tape or tape pool.
.TP
.B taped externalEncryptionKeyScript \fI(no default)\fR
Path to the external script used to obtain encryption keys.

.SS Disk space management options
.TP
.B taped externalFreeDiskSpaceScript \fI(no default)\fR
Path to the external script used to determine free disk space in the retrieve buffer.

.SS Recommended Access Order (RAO) options
.TP
.B taped UseRAO \fIyes\fR
Enable Recommended Access Order (RAO) if available. This setting is used to enable both hardware
and software RAO for all drives that support it. Hardware RAO in IBM Enterprise and LTO drives
generation 9 or later needs no further configuration. The additional RAO options below are for
software RAO on LTO-8 drives.
.TP
.B taped RAOLTOAlgorithm \fIsltf\fR
On LTO-8 tape drives, specify which software RAO algorithm to use. Valid options are \fBlinear\fP,
\fBrandom\fP, \fBsltf\fP. \fBlinear\fP means retrieve files ordered by logical file ID. \fBrandom\fP
means retrieve files in a random order. \fBsltf\fP is the Shortest Locate Time First algorithm, which
traverses the tape by always picking the nearest (lowest cost) neighbour to the last file selected.
The cost function is specified in \fBRAOLTOAlgorithmOptions\fP, below.

.RS
Linear and random ordering are useful only to establish a baseline for RAO tests. This option
should be set to \fBsltf\fP in production environments.
.RE

.RS
Note: the \fBsltf\fP option requires that the following parameters have been specified in the CTA
Catalogue for the LTO-8 media type: \fInbwraps\fR, \fIminlpos\fR, \fImaxlpos\fR. See
\fBcta-admin mediatype\fP.
.RE
.TP
.B taped RAOLTOAlgorithmOptions \fIcost_heuristic_name:cta\fR
Options for the software RAO algorithm specified by \fBRAOLTOAlgorithm\fP, above.
