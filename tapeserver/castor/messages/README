Castor messages for internal communication are now described using Google's API protocol buffers.
For writing a message, I let you look at the documentation
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial or at the existing messages.
The syntax is fairly obvious.

Transforming those messages into C++ code is done by cmake. You dont have to worry about it
Files will be generated into the build directory in castor/messages

Cmake also takes care of adding the new files into the library for linking it with
the others parts of Castor
