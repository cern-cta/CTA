 * This logic is the following:
 * If we were able to query the drive User Data Segments (UDS) limits, then it means
 * that the type of algorithm to instanciate will be an enterprise drive one (instanciate a EnterpriseRAOAlgorithmFactory)
 * 
 * If we were not able to query the drive UDS limits, then it means that we will use a CTA RAO algorithm : linear, random (NonConfigurable RAO Algorithms) or
 * sltf (Configurable RAO Algorithm) 
 * 
 * For implementation, see the implementation of the createAlgorithmFactory() method
