The Tape server project is targeted at replacing the CAStor tape server with a new drop-{}in reimplementation. The reimplementation will replace a legacy implementation that is written in C.

The reimplementation will be done using the latest tools available to us in the current Scientific Linux distribution. The language will be C++, to group concept and variables in self-contained
(and unit testable) objects.

The interface to the mounting deamons might still change with repect to CAStor 2.1.14 as the mounting daemons are being reviewed in parallel.

This documentation itself currently references the older tape server this project is intending to replace. The references will have to be removed as they become unnecessary. 
Likewise, the layout of the document will be adapted.

The tape drive primitives have now been developed, and the rest of the project's
plan is being laid out.

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Targeted environment}

CERN SLC5 and SLC6, 64bits. Although it should compile in theory, the 32 bits version is not tested. The unit test purposely returns an error when run on non-64 bits architecture.

\subsection{Pre-existing requirements}

The new tape server (software) will have to replace the software running on a tape server
(computer). A previous analysis describes the current software stack of the tape servers
	\footnote{ \href{http://svn.cern.ch/guest/CASTOR/CASTOR2/trunk/castor/tape/doc/TapeBridge.pdf}
	{http://svn.cern.ch/guest/CASTOR/CASTOR2/trunk/castor/tape/doc/TapeBridge.pdf}}.
This new tape server will retain the same external interfaces as the old tape server, replacing 
the stack of daemons from the tape bridge down to the tape drive hardware.

The tape server will interface with the Volume and Drive Queue Manager daemon (vdqmd), the Volume
manager daemon (vmgrd), the Castor User Privilege Validation daemon (cupvd) and tape gateway 
daemon (tapegatewayd) for data transfer management and access control.

It will connect to the CAStor disk servers to transfer the data itself, using one of the supported
protocols (current candidates are rfio, xroot and ceph) and it will use the services of the Remote 
Media Changer daemon (rmcd) to mount and unmount tapes.

\subsubsection{Tape session triggering}

The tape server acts as a server only on one occasion, when it receives a client info request from the 
VDQM. This call triggers a tape session, recall or migrate. The information received at that point
is only client system information and drive information (request ID, host, port, DGN, tape drive name and user information (user id, etc...)).

The main thread of the tape server will then just forks (and maybe exec, to be decided (TODO)) a new
process, which will handle the session and quit.

A new session starts with the tape server connecting with the client (it could be the tape gateway, or one of the command line commands of castor (currently packages in castor-tapebridge-client: readtp, writetp, 
dumptp). In the case of the tape gateway, it can be either a read or a write session.

The collaboration diagrams of the previous version of the tape server (with all its sub components)
can be found in dot format
	\footnote{ \href{http://svn.cern.ch/guest/CASTOR/CASTOR2/trunk/castor/tape/doc/collaboration\_diagrams/}
	{http://svn.cern.ch/guest/CASTOR/CASTOR2/trunk/castor/tape/doc/collaboration\_diagrams/}}.
	
The new sequencing of a session start, simplified from the internal component communication is shown here:

\begin{center}
\begin{sequencediagram}
	\newthread{vm}{vmgrd}
	\newthread{vd}{vdqmd}
	\newthread{ts}{tapeserverd(main)}
	\newinst{tsc}{tapeserverd(child)}
	\newthread{gw}{client(gateway or command line)}
	
	\begin{call}{gw}{get volume}{vm}{tape VID}
	\end{call}
	\begin{call}{gw}{vdqm request/volume stuff}{vd}{VDQM request ID}
	\end{call}
	\begin{call}{vd}{schedule}{vd}{}
	\end{call}
	\begin{call}{ts}{unitStatus(UP)}{vd}{}
	\end{call}
	\begin{call}{vd}{schedule}{vd}{}
	\end{call}
	\begin{call}{vd}{VDQM\_CLIENTINFO}{ts}{}
	\end{call}
	\begin{call}{ts}{fork}{tsc}{}
		\begin{call}{tsc}{Volume request}{gw}{}
		\end{call}
		\begin{call}{tsc}{Proceed with session}{tsc}{}
		\end{call}
	\end{call}

\end{sequencediagram}
\end{center}

At that point, already two client libraries are in use in the tape server: the {\bf{}tape gateway protocol client} library and the {\bf{}vdqm client} library, and a simple server, answering only one type or requests:

\begin{itemize}
\item{}The client library for the tape gateway is implemented using the UML/umbrello based serialisation system. It is contained in the \verb#castor::tape::tapebridge::ClientProxy# class in CAStor.
\item{}The direct C client API in CAStor's \verb#h/vdqm_api.h#.
\item{}The VDQM request handler is implemented in the server class \verb#castor::tape::tapebridge::VdqmRequestHandler#.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tape session startup}

Upon reception of the session request, the tape server checks that it can continue with the session:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}with VMGR the volume status and block size. A disabled volume can only be mounted by a TP\_OPER (this information is retrieved from cupv).
\item{}In case of a write session, it queries the pool info know the owner. If user is not the owner or ADMIN, refuse the mount.
\end{itemize}

Then reports are sent:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Reports to VDQM that the drive is assigned. (VDQM\_UNITSTATUS).
\item{}Requests work to be done from the client to prevent useless mounts (and start caching data 
in case of migration.
\item{}Mounts the tape, rewinds and validates the volume label.
\item{}Reports to VMGR that the volume is mounted (\verb#VMGR_TPMOUNTED#).
\item{}Reports to the VDQM that the tape is mounted (VDQM\_UNITSTATUS).
\end{itemize}

This part adds the {\bf{}vmgr client} and the {\bf{}rmcd client}.

TODO: bad day scenario.

\subsubsection{Work loop}
The work loop will be a 4 step pipelined operation where:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}The work to be done FIFO gets topped up continuously  by a thread (using bulk)
\item{}The data FIFO(s) is(are) filled up by the reader (tape thread or disk thread).
\item{}The data FIFO consumer (opposite)
\item{}The results are reported by either the control thread or a specialized thread (using bulk).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Release tape}

\subsection{Extra requirements}
Additional requirements, arising from the current practices of operators are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{}The tape server's session should gracefully handle an unclean situation where the 
tape is left in the drive by a previously crashed session. The protocol is to clean anything
left over before proceeding to the new session.
\item{}A tape sessions should be preemptable by the operator. This is currently achieved 
by killing the tape process. Closing the session on a kill (-1) could be a solution.
\item{}The operator should be able to specify values in different SCSI code pages in
order to setup the tape drive. This setting will be defined differently for each tape
drive type.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tape server architecture}
To fulfil the requirement for an ability to kill a session, the main tape server daemon
will be simple, and just report its status to the VDQM and wait for requests from it on
an open port.

When a tape mount should start, the process will fork a child process, which will reserve the memory
and instantiate the tape mount machinery.

The layout of the main process is show in figure \ref{tsParentProcess}. The layout of the child process, which contains all the complexity is shown in figure \ref{tsChildProcess}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/TapeServerParentProcess}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{tsParentProcess}Tape server parent process: libraries used (purpose built libraries in blue, system libraries in beige, already existing CAStor libraries in green)}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/TapeServerChildProcess}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{tsChildProcess}Tape server child process: libraries used (purpose built libraries in blue, system libraries in beige, already existing CAStor libraries in green)}
\end{figure}

The data path will go to/from tape drive, through the generic SCSI interface of st driver (CAStor uses a
mixture of both in the Tape::Drive class), then through the File structure support classes, as controlled by
the tape thread. The tape thread will communicate the data to (or get from) the disk threads via the 
data FIFO class. This class will in turn allocate the memory from a preallocated, pool of
fixed sized blocks. The size of the pool will be controlled by the operators.

The file structure support classes will be arranged in two layers, with two distinct 
implementations for read and write. The lower layer, the session will be stateful, and validate
that the conditions are correct before operations (correct tape is identified in the drive thanks 
to volume label, and proper position is confirmed thanks to last file trailer before writing).
Positioning can also be optimized if file to file information is retained (mostly, we should 
avoid repositioning between consecutive files when reading).

Some libraries already exist in CAStor, and will be reused, either by copying or linking from pre-compiled 
packages. The main parts of the sessions spawner will be taken from the VDQM as well.

\section{Reference documentations}
\subsection{SCSI specifications}

The SCSI commands can be found in the SCSI section of Hackipedia.org
      \footnote{ \href{http://hackipedia.org/Hardware/SCSI/}{http://hackipedia.org/Hardware/SCSI/} }
      \footnote{The official site for SCSI standard is \href{http://T10.org}{http://T10.org}. All specifications
      can be found there in their approved version, but behind a paywall. Nevertheless all previous drafts were
      public and can conveniently be found on the web. Hackipedia hold a very nice collection of such
      documentations.}.
 The most significant documents for tape server development are the SCSI stream commands (SSC-3
      \footnote{ \href{http://hackipedia.org/Hardware/SCSI/Stream\%20Commands/SCSI\%20Stream\%20Commands\%20-\%203.pdf}
                      {http://hackipedia.org/Hardware/SCSI/Stream\%20Commands/SCSI\%20Stream\%20Commands\%20-\%203.pdf} })
 and the SCSI primary commands (SPC-4
      \footnote{ \href{http://hackipedia.org/Hardware/SCSI/Primary\%20Commands/SCSI\%20Primary\%20Commands\%20-\%204.pdf}
                      {http://hackipedia.org/Hardware/SCSI/Primary\%20Commands/SCSI\%20Primary\%20Commands\%20-\%204.pdf} }
      \footnote{ Latest drafts can be downloaded from \href{http://www.t10.org/members/w\_spc4.htm}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{SCSI support in Linux}
On the Linux side, the main references are the Linux 2.4 SCSI subsystem HOWTO
       \footnote{ \href{http://mirrors.kernel.org/LDP/HOWTO/pdf/SCSI-2.4-HOWTO.pdf}
                       {http://mirrors.kernel.org/LDP/HOWTO/pdf/SCSI-2.4-HOWTO.pdf} },
especially for its section 9.3 on the st driver,
and the Linux SCSI Generic (sg) HOWTO 
       \footnote{ \href{http://mirrors.kernel.org/LDP/HOWTO/pdf/SCSI-Generic-HOWTO.pdf}
                       {http://mirrors.kernel.org/LDP/HOWTO/pdf/SCSI-Generic-HOWTO.pdf} }. 

More details regarding the Generic SCSI driver can be found on the SCSI subsystem maintainer's web site 
       \footnote{ \href{http://sg.danny.cz/sg/}{http://sg.danny.cz/sg/} }.

The section on the SG\_IO ioctl, \footnote{ \href{http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg\textunderscore{}io.html}{http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg\textunderscore{}io.html} } details the usage of the 
simplest ioctl for the generic SCSI driver, which allows the invocation of a SCSI command and the collection of the 
result in a single system call.

This ioctl is provided in the middle layer of the SCSI subsystem of Linux. All SCSI drivers, st included, fall back
to the middle layer when encountering an unknown ioctl. This means there is no need to open the matching generic SCSI,
unless we want to control command queueing with separate sending of commands and result collection, which
requires the use of read and write calls from the generic SCSI (sg) driver.

\subsection{Unsorted CAStor docs}
A collection of links to various documentations written in the past is available on one of CAStor's web pages
       \footnote{ \href{http://castorwww.web.cern.ch/castorwww/links.htm}{http://castorwww.web.cern.ch/castorwww/links.htm} }.

\subsection{SCSI tape support in Linux (st driver)}
Generic SCSI allows detailed control of the operations, but the bulk of them (including reading and
writing) can be managed by the higher level SCSI tape (or st) driver provided by the Linux kernel.
More information on the st driver can be found in the man page "st" and in \verb#Documentation/scsi/st.txt#
in the sources of the kernel.

\section{Tools used during development}

\section{Data transfer session step by step}
The following sequence describes when and what the different components of castor communicate while a  data transfer if occurring 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Tape operator runs "readtp V12345" -n 1 or "writetp V12345 /etc/group"
\item readtp/writetp queries \textbf{vmgrd} for information about the the tape with volume identifier V12345
\item readtp/writetp queries \textbf{cupvd} to determine whether or not the tape operator really has the TP\_OPER privilege
\item readtp/writetp aborts if the tape is DISABLED and the tape operator does not have the TP\_OPER privilege
\item readtp/writetp aborts if the tape is either EXPORTED or ARCHIVED
\item readtp/writetp binds a TCP/IP listening socket ready for callbacks from a \textbf{mount-session} child-process of \textbf{tapeserverd}
\item readtp/writetp requests \textbf{vdqmd} to allocate it a free drive in the same DGN as tape V12345 - readtp sends its callback port in the request
\item The RequestHandlerThread of \textbf{vdqmd} stores the readtp/writetp request in the database
\item The DriveSchedulerThread of \textbf{vdqmd} allocates a free drive to the readtp/writetp request
\item The RtcpJobSubmitterThread of \textbf{vdqmd} sends a job to \textbf{tapeserverd}
\item \textbf{tapeserverd} checks that the vdqm’s hostname is in the ADMIN HOSTS parameter of /etc/castor/castor.conf
\item \textbf{tapeserverd} forks a \textbf{mount-session} child-process.
\item The TapeDaemon::forkMountSession() function of the child process asks the \textbf{vdqmd} daemon to assign the process ID to the drive.
\begin{itemize}
\item        VdqmProxy::assignDrive()
\end{itemize}
\item The child process creates the MountSession object and calls MountSession::execute().
\item \textbf{mount-session} asks readtp/writetp for the details of the mount (tapegateway::Volume)
\item \textbf{mount-session} sends the mount details (tapegateway::Volume) to the \textbf{tapeserverd} parent process
\begin{itemize}
\item        TapeserverProxy::gotReadMountDetailsFromClient()
\item        TapeserverProxy::gotWriteMountDetailsFromClient()
\end{itemize}
\item If writing to tape and the client is the tapegatewayd daemon then the \textbf{tapeserverd} parent process checks with the \textbf{vmgrd} daemon that the tape is marked as BUSY. A tape is marked as busy as a result of the tapegatwayd daemon calling vmgr\_gettape().
\item \textbf{mount-session} asks readtp/writetp for the first file to be recalled or migrated
\item \textbf{mount-session} requests rmcd to mount the tape - the request is synchronous
\begin{itemize}
\item        RmcProxy::mountTape()
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{mount-session} checks with the drive that the tape has been mounted
\item \textbf{mount-session} notifies the tapserverd parent process that the tape has been mounted
\begin{itemize}
\item        TapeserverProxy::tapeMountedForRead()
\item        TapeserverProxy::tapeMountedForWrite()
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{tapeserverd} via MountSessionAcceptHandler::handleIncomingUpdateDriveJob() notifies the \textbf{vmgrd} daemon that the tape has been mounted
\begin{itemize}
\item        VmgrProxy::tapeMountedForRead()
\item        VmgrProxy::tapeMountedForWrite()
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{tapeserverd} via MountSessionAcceptHandler::handleIncomingUpdateDriveJob() notifies the \textbf{vdqmd} daemon that the tape has been mounted
\begin{itemize}
\item        VdqmProxy::tapeMounted()
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{mount-session} recalls/migrates and requests more files until gateway::NoMore
\item \textbf{mount-session} unloads tape from drive
\item \textbf{mount-session} requests rmcd to unmount the tape - the request is synchronous
\begin{itemize}
\item        RmcProxy::unmountTape()
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{mount-session} notifies \textbf{tapeserverd} the tape has been unmounted - currently this is not used
\begin{itemize}
\item        TapeserverProxy::tapeUnmounted()
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{mount-session} terminates with the success value of 0
\item \textbf{tapeserverd} reaps the zombie \textbf{mount-session}
\item \textbf{tapeserverd} parent-process marks the drive as FREE
\item \textbf{tapeserverd} via TapeDaemon::postProcessReapedDataTransferSession() notifies \textbf{vdqmd} that it is releasing the tape
\begin{itemize}
\item        VdqmProxy::releaseDrive(forceUnmount)
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{tapeserverd} via TapeDaemon::postProcessReapedDataTransferSession() notifies \textbf{vdqmd} the tape has been unmounted
\begin{itemize}
\item        VdqmProxy::tapeUnmounted()
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}


\section{Software layout}

\subsection{SCSI structures, constants and endianness}

In order to make the code readable, and to avoid heavy mask-and-shift usage (which one would tend
to code using litterals in order to avoid many constants definitions), we use bit field structures.
The unused fields can be left anonymous.
The definition is shown in listing \ref{SCSI_struct}, and usage in listing \ref{SCSI_struct_usage}.
As there could be endianness issues, we limit this usage to within bytes. Fortunately, the SCSI 
standard nicely adheres to this rule.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=SCSI::Structures example,label=SCSI_struct]
namespace SCSI {
  namespace Structures {

    /*
     * Inquiry data as described in SPC-4.
     */
    typedef struct {
      unsigned char perifDevType : 5;
      unsigned char perifQualifyer : 3;

      unsigned char : 7;
      unsigned char RMB : 1;

      unsigned char version : 8;

      unsigned char respDataFmt : 4;
      unsigned char HiSup : 1;
      unsigned char normACA : 1;
      unsigned char : 2;
[...]
    } inquiryData_t;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=SCSI::Structures usage example,label=SCSI_struct_usage]
      SCSI::Structures::inquiryData_t & inq = *((SCSI::Structures::inquiryData_t *) dataBuff);
      std::stringstream inqDump;
      inqDump << std::hex << std::showbase << std::nouppercase
              << "inq.perifDevType=" << (int) inq.perifDevType << std::endl
              << "inq.perifQualifyer=" << (int) inq.perifQualifyer << std::endl
[...]
              << "inq.T10Vendor="      << SCSI::Structures::toString(inq.T10Vendor) << std::endl
              << "inq.prodId="         << SCSI::Structures::toString(inq.prodId) << std::endl
              << "inq.prodRevLv="      << SCSI::Structures::toString(inq.prodRevLvl) << std::endl
              << "inq.vendorSpecific1="<< SCSI::Structures::toString(inq.vendorSpecific1)<< std::endl
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}

The unit test resorts to shift and mask, once and only once, to validate the bit fields in
another way. There is an example for this validation in \verb#SCSI/StructureTest.cc# an excerpt is in listing \ref{SCSI_struct_testing}.

\begin{table}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=SCSI::Structures usage example,label=SCSI_struct_testing]
namespace UnitTests {
  TEST(SCSI_Structures, inquiryData_t_multi_byte_numbers_strings) {
    /* Validate the bit field behavior of the struct inquiryData_t,
     which represents the standard INQUIRY data format as defined in 
     SPC-4. This test also validates the handling of multi-bytes numbers,
     as SCSI structures are big endian (and main development target is 
     little endian.  */
    unsigned char inqBuff [100];
    memset(inqBuff, 0, sizeof(inqBuff));
    SCSI::Structures::inquiryData_t & inq = *((SCSI::Structures::inquiryData_t *) inqBuff);
    /* Peripheral device type */
    ASSERT_EQ(0, inq.perifDevType);
    inqBuff[0] |= (0x1A & 0x1F) << 0;
    ASSERT_EQ(0x1A, inq.perifDevType);
    
    /* Peripheral qualifier */
    ASSERT_EQ(0, inq.perifQualifyer);
    inqBuff[0] |= (0x5 & 0x7) << 5;
    ASSERT_EQ(0x5, inq.perifQualifyer);
[...]
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}

Other common types in the SCSI specification are multi-bytes
number, which are represented by \verb#unsigned char[2/* (or 4)*/]# and handled by helper functions 
\verb#toU16()# and \verb#toU32()#. The helper functions
conveniently use \verb#ntoh{l|s}#, as SCSI and network orders are the same. The reverse
is covered by \verb#setU16()# and \verb#setU32()#. Another helper function 
takes care of string extraction from fixed sized char arrays. See listing \ref{SCSI_data_helpers}.

\begin{table}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=SCSI::Structures helper functions,label=SCSI_data_helpers]
SCSI::Structures::uint32_t toU32(const char(& t)[4]);
SCSI::Structures::uint32_t toU32(const char(& t)[4]);

template <size_t n>
std::string toString(const char(& t)[n]);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}

Those arrays are space-padded, and may not be 0 terminated. It is seen in listing \ref{SCSI_struct_usage}.
The helper function extracts the string, dealing with potential zeros at the end,
and the fixed length. They keep the space-padding at the end of the extracted
string.

To avoid literals in the code, which forces anyone reading it to do tedious lookups,
the SCSI constants are also defined as constants in the code. See listing \ref{SCSI_consts}.

\begin{table}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=SCSI::Constants,label=SCSI_consts]
namespace SCSI {
  class Commands {
  public:
    enum {
      /*
       *      SCSI opcodes, taken from linux kernel sources
       *      Linux kernel's is more complete than system's
       *      includes.
       */
      TEST_UNIT_READY                               = 0x00,
      REZERO_UNIT                                   = 0x01,
      REQUEST_SENSE                                 = 0x03,
[...]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}

Finally all structures have a constructor, which at least zeroes all the data.
Some structures (typically the CDBs, where the first byte is the operation's code)
automatically set the value of fields which can only have one value. Helper
functions are created as needed, where accessing/setting the data in the structure
requires non-trivial processing (and when the case is not covered by the common
tools handling strings that endianness).

\subsection{Exceptions hierarchy and error handling strategy}

There is a small class hierarchy for exceptions: \verb#Tape::Exception# inherits from
\verb#std::exception#, and \verb#Tape::Exceptions::Errnum# inherits from the latter.
\verb#Tape::Exceptions::Errnum# manages the errnos. It collects the errno value and turns it
into a string automatically at construction time.

\verb#Tape::Exception# and all its heirs automatically generate a stack trace at creation time.
This allows easy tracing of unhandled exceptions, as the stack trace is embedded in the content
of the \verb#what()# method. For the cases where the exception is indeed handled, a shorter version
called \verb#shortWhat()# allows the logging of the problem without bloating the logs with long stack 
traces.

Another exception class, \verb#SCSI::Exception#, turns the SCSI status and sense buffer into a
user readable string. In addition, a helper exception thrower function avoids code
repetitions (\verb#ExceptionLauncher()#).

Throughout the project, the error handling strategy is to throw an exception when any
error condition occurs. This ensures that any returned value is valid, and prevents the 
calling function from testing for error conditions. The default exception throwing is
coming from a narrow set of exceptions types. This gives a crude exception handling capacity
to the user of the functions. When finer grained exceptions will turn out to be required,
we will add them on an as needed basis.

\subsection{Non-fatal warnings strategy}
\label{Non-fatal warnings strategy}


We want to deliver an interface, preferably common, to most object where the non-fatal
problems are recorded (with time of occurrence) and stored for further retrieval by
upstream caller. This allow developers to deal with the logging interface only in the 
top "application" class which glues all the bricks of the project together.

A lower level failure (exception) could also be turned into a warning by a higher level
retry.

TODO: define API.

\subsection{The Tape::Drive object}

This first deliverable is a tape drive object. This tape drive object abstracts all
SCSI and technical details and provides a high level interface, to be used by the 
file structure layer.

It will provide as much data safety as possible by blocking writes in situations
where they are not safe (to be defined in details, but the most obvious is right
after positioning, as the file layer is expected to check the position by reading
the trailer of the previous file before writing.

The SCSI commands and st driver's functions used in previous software (CAStor's taped/rtcpd) are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Individual SCSI commands sent using generic SCSI:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Read status (inquiry SCSI command used by posovl)
    \item Read serial number (inquiry SCSI command, asking for vital product data page 0x80)
    \item Locate (locate(10) SCSI command: 32 bits logical object identifiers)
                      \footnote{There is also a locate(16) command allowing 64 bis addresses.
                      This might become necessary as tapes grow. Discounting the per-file overhead,
                      with 256kB block, it still takes 1PB to get $2^{32}$ blocks.}
    \item Read position (read position SCSI command -- short form): get the current logical object
          location (a.k.a. block ID).
    \item Log select (for clearing compression stats page. The function clear\_compression\_stats
          actually does a blanket reset of all statistics. It sets the PCR/SP/PC combination
          to 1/0/3. The basic SCSI specification states that the value pf PC is not important,
          but for the T10000 drives, the documentation recommends PC=11b, which we have for all drives.
    \item Log sense, to read the compression pages. This is device dependant. The code covers
          5 blocks of device types: DAT, DLT-SDLT-LTO, IBM(3490, 3590, 3592), StorageTek RedWood(SD3),
          StorageTek(9840, 9940, T10000).
    \item Log sense for page 0x2E (tape alert, as defined in SSC-3) on all modern tape drives to detect tape alerts.
    \item Mode sense and Mode select was used in setdens called itself by mounttape.
          They get the drive parameters and set density and compression parameters based
          on the drive type and the density requested by the caller. On all modern tape drives,
          the compression page is 0x10. This will be replaced by the function \verb#Tape::Drive::setCompressionAndDensity()#.
  \end{itemize}
\item st driver's commands, leading to internal variables setting or SCSI actions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Get internal driver state via the MTIOCGET ioctl (for drive ready, write protection, 
          get some error condition, when MTIOSENSE failed, to get the EOD, BOT bits (readlbl)).
          This functionality is covered by \verb#Drive::getDriveStatus#.
    \item Try and get the sense data for the last-ish command with MTIOSENSE. This
          relies on a CERN-made patch. As the patch is not available in SLC6, 
          MTIOSENSE will not be used in this project. This is also covered \verb#Drive::getDriveStatus#.
    \item Setup the driver's parameters (MTIOCTOP/MTSETDRVBUFFER) for (un)buffered 
          writes and asynchronous writes (in confdrive, a child process of taped).
          This option is currently not set in production environments.
    \item Jump to end of media (before rewinding, as a mean to rebuild the MIR) (MTIOCTOP/MTEOM, 
          with some MTIOCTOP/MTSETDRVBUFFER before, in repairbadmir). The setting of the driver
          buffer is used to set the boolean flag MT\_ST\_FAST\_MTEOM to 0. If not, the mt driver uses
          a nasty trick asks the device to skip 0x7fffff files forward. The comment in the CAStor code
          claims it's 32k files, but $2^{23}-1$ is indeed 8M files. Anyway, after turning off the 
          option, the st driver reverts to telling the SCSI device to space to end of data.
          This behavior is documented in the IBM's operator manual mentioned in \ref{Manufacturer's specificities},
          on page 53 for tape alert 18 (Tape directory corrupted on load).

          It is not mentioned for other tape server's documentations. Specifically, StorageTek
          only lists operator-initiated methods for MIR rebuild.

          Nevertheless, we will still issue this operation in all drives as it is not known
          if it works in practice for StorageTek drives (or others).
    \item Rewind (MTIOCTOP/MTREW, in rwndtape).
    \item Skip to end of data (MTIOCTOP/MTEOM, in skip2eod, without the trick of repairbadmir).
    \item Skip n file marks backwards (MTIOCTOP/MTBSF, in skiptpfb).
    \item Skip n file marks forward (MTIOCTOP/MTFSF, in skiptpff).
    \item Skip n file marks forward (MTIOCTOP/MTFSF, in skiptpfff). skiptpfff and skiptpff differ only 
          by error reporting. Both functions exists since CAStor has been put in SVN (20/07/1999)
    \item Skip n blocks backwards (MTIOCTOP/MTBSR, in skiptprb).
    \item Skip n blocks forward (MTIOCTOP/MTFSR, in skiptprf).
    \item Unload the tape (MTIOCTOP/MTOFFL, in unldtape).
    \item Write synchronous file mark(s) (tape marks in CAStor jargon) (MTIOCTOP/MTWEOF, in wrttpmrk).
    \item Write immediate (asynchronous file marks (MTIOCTOP/MTWEOFI, also in wrttpmrk).
    \item Clear the EOT condition by calling MTIOCGET. This is done in wrttrllbl, 3 times.
          In MTIOCGET, indeed, a member of the scsi\_tape structure called recover\_reg is reset to 0.
          This clearing is used to properly report errors in label writing functions.
          The usefulness of this function is dubious and it is not included in the current
          API.
    \item Write is used in 2 places only : twrite and writelbl (which is a specialized 
          function to write 80 bytes blocks). twrite is not checking the size of blocks,
          which is determined in the calling functions.
    \item Read is used in tread, which is used in a single place of TapeToMemory. It is 
          also used in readlbl. The latter uses a trick to detect that a tape is blank.
          This could be turned into a specialized function.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The interface is shown in listing \ref{drive_if}.

\subsection{The Tape::File class}
\subsubsection{CAStor file format}
Over time, CAStor used several file formats, but as of 2013, only one file format
is used, called AUL. This format is described an old CERN web site
\footnote{ \href{http://it-dep-fio-ds.web.cern.ch/it-dep-fio-ds/Documentation/tapedrive/labels.html}{http://it-dep-fio-ds.web.cern.ch/it-dep-fio-ds/Documentation/tapedrive/labels.html} },
and the general description of the ANSI fields can be found in IBM's z/OS documentation
\footnote{ \href{http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=\%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.idam300\%2Flabdef.htm}{http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=\%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.idam300\%2Flabdef.htm} }.

The AUL format consists of volume label, header blocks and trailer blocks. All those
descriptors are contained in tape blocks of 80 bytes. All data is in ASCII nowadays and empty bytes are spaces.

\subsubsection{File block management}

Some files tapes have mixed block sizes,
some files used to have mixed block sizes. Current proposal is to have a fixed
block size per tape, and to have operators choose the optimal block size for 
drive performance (too small blocks reduce performance). 

Currently 256kB is used everywhere, so hardcoding this block size for writing 
to this value is an acceptable for the time being. On the long run, this should 
be a configurable parameter by the operators.

Ideally, only the Tape::File class should handle all aspects of cutting the disk
file, which is a continuous stream, into fixed size blocks. But this would have the 
downside of having the Tape::File class a client of the FIFOs, and potentially 
have its own thread, which is far beyond the scope of this class. Therefore, it 
is the duty of the caller to provide the file cut into fixed size blocks.
The Tape::File class will require pre-declaration of the block size, and 
enforce it.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities of the class}
This class will have the responsibility to check file structure and content,
including checksum, block sizes and header/trailer content. In case of non-fatal
errors, the warnings will be reported through the warning interface described in
\ref{Non-fatal warnings strategy}.

\subsubsection{Checksums}
The checksum in CAStor uses the Adler32 checksum. Adler32 can be computed 
incrementally on a stream of data. The zlib contains an implementation of adler32
\footnote{\href{http://www.zlib.net/manual.html\#Checksum}{http://www.zlib.net/manual.html\#Checksum}}.
The checksum will be computer automatically when writing or reading the file to
tape. Reading a file with a wrong checksum will throw an exception.
TODO: define writing behavior (is the checksum pre-declared?).

\subsubsection{Tape::File API}
TODO.



\subsection{FIFOs}

FIFOs will be used to synchronize the data transfer between the tape thread and 
disk threads. The Tape thread will manage the block-to-stream transformation. The
FIFO might not always be able to provide blocks in one piece at chunk boundary.
The first attempt solution for this case will be a copy of the cut block. With
a chunk size significantly bigger than the block size, the event should be rare
enough to not affect performance. FIFOs will probably need some thread safety,
but as they will be single user, single consumer, some parts might possible 
be lockless.

\subsection{Disk client library}
Castor is dropping rfio and is moving to xroot. The effects on the code are to be
discussed with Sebastien.
\subsection{VDQM client library}

TODO: describe how we will link with the VDQM client library. The VDQM is also 
the initial client which triggers the tape sessions. It carries a feature
where the tape drive can recycle a tape mount. This is not very useful today,
and the first release of the TapeServer will not support it. All sessions
will be force-closed by the TapeServer.

\subsection{VMGR client library}

\subsection{Stager/TapeGateway client library}

\subsection{Logging system client library}
In case of failure,  operators need to have logs filles as much as possible. 
Thus, castor has an very aggressive logging strategy and every step of execution within the process 
is monitored.

Each thread has it own \textbf{log::LogContext}, which is holding a set of variables that have to be log in every case 
with every message. That way, we do bother only once with the variables to 
log (when adding them to the log context) and can focus on the log message.

The variables are stored within the \textbf{log::LogContex} as \textbf{log::Param}, which is roughly speaking a pair of string 
for the name of the parameter and its value.

Adding variables is done through \textbf{LogContext::pushOrReplace}, removing them through \textbf{LogContext::erase} and the 
logging through the \textbf{log} member function.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
log::Logger log;
log::LogContext lc(log);
{
  lc.pushOrReplace(cta::log::Param("Name var 1",var1));
  lc.log(LEVEL,message);
  lc.erase("Name var 1");
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}
To avoid this cumbersome add/remove, you can use \textbf{LogContext::ScopedParameter}, which is 
a RAII-class for registering a variable into the \textbf{LogContext} and removing it automatically when its goes out of scope.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  cta::log::LogContext::ScopedParam sp(lc, cta::log::Param("name var1",var1));
  cta::log::LogContext::ScopedParam sp2(lc, cta::log::Param("name var2",var2));
  lc.log(LEVEL,message);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}
Using \textbf{LogContext::ScopedParameter} is still a bit clunky. To get rid of that, there is the 
\textbf{ScopedParamContainer}, which acts as RAII container for parameters.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  cta::log::ScopedParamContainer sp(lc);
  sp.add(var1, "name1").add(var2, "name2");
  lc.log(LEVEL,message);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}
\subsection{Application architecture}
\subsubsection{Memory management and threading architecture}
Like the previous version in rtcpd, the tape server will pre-allocate a fixed number of memory
blocks for the whole duration of the tape session, and circulate them between the data producers 
and consumers.

The data flow is organised around block passing, from queue to queue. Each queue output is processed
by a thread of thread pool.

The overall layout of a migration mount is shown in figure \ref{tsMigrationMM}. The recall mount, shown in\
figure \ref{tsRecallMM}, is almost symmetric. The report packer triggers on threshold instead of tape 
flushes, and

\subsubsection{Session spawner}
\subsubsection{Session process}

\subsubsection{Memory chunk manager}

The memory block manager allocates (usually all at once) a large chunk of memory.
This memory is then shared between the various FIFOs in the system. Deallocation
of memory on exit will allow memory leak checks. 

\paragraph{Recall}
In case of a recall, the memory manager is pretty much an empty shell.
Memory blocks are sequentially pulled by the current tape read task and pushed back to the memory manager once written to the disk
\paragraph{Migration}
In case of a migration, he memory manager has an active role. 
He has a list of clients that are waiting for some memory blocks. It pushes to them  


\subsubsection{Tape read thread}
Behavior :
Beginning : 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Load tape
\item Mount tape
\item wait for drive to be ready
\item Check the label and position the tape 
\end{itemize}
Run 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Pop a queued task (and ask the task injector to put more tasks in) 
\item execute 
\end{itemize}
At the end :
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Signal the end to the global status reporter
\item Signal to the task injector that he can stop 
\item attempt of cleaning : unmount and unload the tape
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Tape write thread}
Behavior :
Beginning : 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Load tape
\item Mount tape
\item wait for drive to be ready
\item Check the label and position the tape 
\end{itemize}
Run 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Pop a queued task 
\item execute 
\item Report to the client if a threshold has been crossed
\end{itemize}
At the end :
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Signal the end to the global status reporter
\item attempt of cleaning : unmount and unload the tape
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Disk read thread pool}
It is an empty shell owning and running a set of disk read threads. Each thread will pop a task and execute it.
While popping a task, we ask the task injector to provide more task if we cross on the thresholds.
The last thread alive will report the end of the session to the client 
\subsubsection{Disk write thread pool}
It is also an empty shell owning and running a set of disk write threads. Each thread will pop a task and execute it.
The last thread alive will report the end of the session to the client 
\subsubsection{Global status reporter}

\subsubsection{Task injector}
\paragraph{Recall}
\paragraph{Migration}
\subsubsection{Loopback system}

\subsection{How to interpret the exit code of the mount-session child process}
An exit code of 0 means the underlying drive is free to be used again and the tapeserverd parent-process should therefore move the state of the drive to UP (idle in tpstat and FREE in showqueues).

A non-zero exit code means the tapeserverd parent-process should move the state of underlying drive to DOWN.  An operator will take a look. Under no circumstances should the tapeserverd daemon launch a Leon/Victor process to clean the situation.

If the mount-session child-process terminates without an exit code (it received a terminating signal) then the Leon/Victor process should be launched.

\section{Compilation instructions}

Install SLC 6 (or 5)
Install cmake and git if they are not installed out of the box
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
yum -y install python-debian cmake git
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
cd 
git clone http://git.cern.ch/pub/CASTOR castor
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DPackageOnly:bool=true ../castor/
make castor_rpm
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}
The last command will give you a list of missing packages that are needed.
Most of them can be installed with a simple yum install when epel repository is enabled.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
yum install -y libattr-devel binutils-devel python-devel xfsprogs-devel gtest gtest-devel globus-gridftp-server-devel globus-common-devel cppunit-devel e2fsprogs-devel openssl-devel krb5-devel curl-devel zeromq3 zeromq3-devel protobuf-compiler protobuf protobuf-devel valgrind
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}


But you need get and install manualy from swrep\footnote{http://swrep/swrep/} at least the following packages :
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
 \item gmock-1.5.0-3
 \item gmock-devel-1.5.0-3
 \item libmemcached-0.53-1
 \item libmemcached-devel-0.53-1
 \item oracle-instantclient-basic-11.2.0.3.0-5
 \item oracle-instantclient-precomp-11.2.0.3.0-5 
 \item oracle-instantclient-devel-11.2.0.3.0-5  
 \item stk-ssi-devel-2.3-3.cern
 \item stk-ssi-2.3-3.cern
\end{itemize}


Ceph is also need. The following command should take care of that : 
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
yum localinstall http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/ceph-0.80.1-0.cern.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/ceph-devel-0.80.1-0.cern.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/librados2-0.80.1-0.cern.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/python-ceph-0.80.1-0.cern.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/libradosstriper-0.80.1-0.cern.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/libcephfs_jni1-0.80.1-0.cern.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/libcephfs1-0.80.1-0.cern.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/librbd1-0.80.1-0.cern.x86_64.rpm
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}

You may install ceph-debuginfo (2.8 Go) if you need to.

xrootd4 packages for SLC6 could be installed by : 
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
yum localinstall http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/xrootd4-devel-4.0.0-1.slc6.x86_64.rpm  http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/xrootd4-libs-4.0.0-1.slc6.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/xrootd4-private-devel-4.0.0-1.slc6.noarch.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/xrootd4-client-libs-4.0.0-1.slc6.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/xrootd4-server-libs-4.0.0-1.slc6.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/xrootd4-client-4.0.0-1.slc6.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/xrootd4-client-devel-4.0.0-1.slc6.x86_64.rpm http://swrep/swrep/x86_64_slc6/xrootd4-server-devel-4.0.0-1.slc6.x86_64.rpm
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}

After that, you can run again
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
make castor_rpm
\end{lstlisting}
\end{table}

You should have no errors (if some packages are still missing, install it) otherwise it should compile castor and create the rpm package.

A classic compilation is done with the usal \textit{make}.
To run a set of tests \textit{make test} has to be used.
\subsubsection{Compiling on SLC6}
On SLC6, there is clash between oracle-*  and postgresql-devel packages about \textit{sqlca.h}.
The package postgresql-devel provides a new file \textit{sqlca.h}, which has several significant 
differences with the one provided by the oracle-* packages, thus leading the compilation to fail.

\subsubsection{Compiling on SLC5}
On SLC5, an empty line is requiered at the end of each file.
