# Example of a tape configuration file (/etc/cta/TPCONFIG)
#
# A single tape server daemon can control one or two tape drives.  There should
# be one line per tape drive.  Each line should consist of the following 4
# columns delimited by spaces:
#
# driveName logicalLibraryName driveDevicePath librarySlot
#
# Please modify accordingly the UPPERCASE letters and uncomment the following
# line if you have a tape drive in a SCSI compatible library:
#
# DRIVENAME LOGIGICAL_LIBRARY_NAME /dev/XXXX smcDRIVE_ORDINAL
#
# Please modify accordingly the UPPERCASE letters and uncomment the following
# line if you have a tape drive in an ACS library:
#
# DRIVENAME LOGIGICALi_LIBRARY_NAME /dev/XXXX acsACS_NUMBER,LSM_NUMBER,PANEL_NUMBER,TRANSPORT_NUMBER
