# Example tape configuration file (/etc/cta/TPCONFIG)
#
# A single tape server daemon can control one or two tape drives. This file should contain one line
# per tape drive. Each line should consist of the following four elements, delimited by spaces:
#
# DRIVE_NAME            Label for this drive
# LOGICAL_LIBRARY_NAME  Logical tape library that this drive belongs to
# DRIVE_DEVICE          Path to the character special device used to access the drive
# LIBRARY_SLOT          The SCSI media changer address of the drive. This is "smc" + the drive
#                       ordinal number of the device, which can by obtained with "cta-smc -q D"
#
# Example configuration:
#
# DRIVE_NAME LOGICAL_LIBRARY_NAME DRIVE_DEVICE LIBRARY_SLOT
DRIVE0       LIB1                 /dev/nst0    smc1
