.SH NAME
cta-fst-gcd \- Tape aware garbage collector daemon to run on an EOS FST
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "cta-fst-gcd [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcta-fst-gcd\fP is a daemon that runs on an EOS FST and garbage
collects EOS disk copies that have been safely stored to tape.
.P
The \fBcta-fst-gcd\fP daemon scans across every single EOS disk file on
an FST.  A file is garbage collected if:
.IP \[bu] 2
The amount of free space on the corresponding file system is considered
too low.
.IP \[bu]
The file is considered old enough to be garbage collected.
.P
The \fBcta-fst-gcd\fP daemon garbage collects an EOS disk file by
extracting the hexadecimal EOS file identifier from the local disk
filename and then running \fBeos stagerm fxid:<fid-hex>\fP.
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help
Prints the usage message.
.TP
\fB\-c CONFIG, \-\-config CONFIG
Sets the path of the configuration file.  If not set then the default value of
\fB/etc/cta/cta-fst-gcd.conf\fP is used.
.TP
\fB\-s, \-\-stdout
Sets log output to stdout. This disables use of a log file.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Zero on success and non-zero on failure.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/cta/cta-fst-gcd.conf
The default configuration file of the \fBcta-fst-gcd\fP daemon.  This can be
overriden using the \fB\-c\fP/\fB\-\-config\fP option.
.TP
.B /etc/cta/cta-fst-gcd.conf.example\fB
The example configuration file that documents the available configuration
parameters.
.TP
.B /var/log/eos/fst/cta-fst-gcd.log
The default log file of the \fBcta-fst-gcd\fP daemon.  This can be overriden by
modifying \fBcta-fst-gcd.conf\fP accordingly or disabled using the
\fB\-s\fP/\fB\-\-stdout\fP option.
