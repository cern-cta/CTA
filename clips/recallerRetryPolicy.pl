# ARGV[4] = errorCode2
# ARGV[5] = rtcopySeverity2

# the severity assigned by RTCOPY (defined in rtcp_constants.h) and the error text message (may be
# the sys_errlist[] value for the serrno/errno or a more detailed message associated with the
# error) for the Xth retry. Note that the arguments do not necessarily give the retries in
# order (X is given by the database order of the corresponding SEGMENTs).
