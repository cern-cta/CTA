- 2.0.3-1 -

  Bug fix release. Should only be used for IBM 3592 taperservers

- 2.0.3-0 -

  New Features and Changes
  ------------------------

    - Support for ACLs in the nameserver
    - Regular expression support in stager_qry. The feature is
      limited on the server side via the FILEQUERY/MAXNBRESPONSES
      entry in the castor.conf.
    - LSF plugin is using new fixes coming with LSF 6.1-24. This
      allows to remove an internal fork. This change is incompatible
      with any old version of LSF
    - Interface for passing an authorization id to the stager on top
      of a user id.
    - Framework for multithreaded applications was ported to C++
    - Fixed compilation for x86_64 architecture
    - New package castor-dlf-gui
    - tpdaemon uses sg0 device instead of sga
    - Write filemarks with sg driver and immediate bit set

  Upgrade from 2.0.2-*
  --------------------

    - LSF 6.1-24 or higher must be used
    - The database schema has evolved. Use upgrades/2.0.2_to_2.0.3.sql to upgrade
    - Once the database is upgraded, the content of the lastKnownFileName column
      of the CastorFile table is still empty. It will be updated when the files
      are accessed but you can update it by hand using upgrades/2.0.2_to_2.0.3.pl
      Note that the only disadvantage of not updating is that stager_qry -M will
      not return files that were not updated.
    - For the nameserver, the database must be updated first, using the script
      ns/Cns_oracle_add_ACL.sql. Then the daemons can be updated and finally the
      clients. Note that each step is backward compatible, so that an old daemon
      can run on a new database and an old client can contact a new daemon.
