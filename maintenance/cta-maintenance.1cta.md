# NAME

cta-maintenance --- CTA Maintenance daemon

# SYNOPSIS

**cta-maintenance** \[\--config *config_file*] \[\--stdout]] \[\--log-to-file *log_file*] \[\--log-format *format*]\
**cta-maintenance** \--help

# DESCRIPTION

**cta-maintenance** is the daemon responsible for performing housekeeping tasks related to the disk buffer and scheduler. It is composed of different runners that 

**Disk Report Runner**

**Queue Cleanup Runner**

**Garbage Collector Runner**

**Repack Request Runner**

# OPTIONS

-c, \--config *config_file*

:   Read **cta-maintenance** configuration from *config_file* instead of the default,
    */etc/cta/cta-maintenance.conf*.

-h, \--help

:   Display command options and exit.

-l, \--log-to-file *log_file*

:   Log to a file instead of stdout.

-o, \--log-format *format*

:   Output format for log messages. \[default\|json\]

-s, \--stdout

:   Log to standard output. Logging to stdout is the default, but this option is kept for compatibility reasons

# CONFIGURATION

The **cta-maintenance** daemon reads its configuration parameters from the CTA configuration file (by
default, */etc/cta/cta-maintenance.conf*). Each option is listed with its *default* value.

## Tape Server Configuration Options
maintenance LogMask *INFO*

:   Logs with a level lower than this value will be masked. Possible
    values are EMERG, ALERT, CRIT, ERR, WARNING, NOTICE (USERERR), INFO,
    DEBUG. USERERR log level is equivalent to NOTICE, because by
    convention, CTA uses log level NOTICE for user errors.

maintenance LogFormat *json*

:   The default format for log lines is jsos. If
    this option is set to *unstructured*, log lines will be output in key=value format.

maintenance CatalogueConfigFile */etc/cta/cta-catalogue.conf*

:   Path to the CTA Catalogue configuration file. See **FILES**, below.

ObjectStore BackendPath (no default)

:   URL of the objectstore (CTA Scheduler Database). Usually this will
    be the URL of a Ceph RADOS objectstore. For testing or small
    installations, a file-based objectstore can be used instead. See
    **cta-objectstore-initialize**.

## General Configuration Options

This options will be included in every log line of the tape daemon to
enhance log identification when swapping drives between different backends.

InstanceName (no default)

:   Unique string to identify CTA\'s catalogue instance the tape daemon is serving.

SchedulerBackendName (no default)

:   The unique string to identify the backend scheduler resources. It
    can be structured as: \[ceph\|postgres\|vfs]\[User\|Repack].

# FILES

*/etc/cta/cta-maintenance.conf*

:   The CTA Maintenance configuration file, containing the options
    described above under **CONFIGURATION**. See */etc/cta/cta-maintenance.conf.example*.

*/etc/cta/cta-catalogue.conf*

:   Usual location for the CTA Catalogue configuration file. See **CatalogueConfigFile**
    option under **CONFIGURATION**, and */etc/cta/cta-catalogue.conf.example*.

*/var/log/cta/cta-maintenance.log*

:   Usual location for the maintenance log file.
