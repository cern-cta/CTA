COMM We overwrite here the default rule for the compilation of
COMM globus_gridftp_server_CASTOR2xroot in order to be able to alleviate the -Werror
COMM present in the standard flags for the case of "right-hand operand of comma has
COMM no effect". This warning is due to a bad macro from globus and only occurs on
COMM gcc 3.4, that is SLC4. We will thus be able to drop all this from SLC5 on
globus_gridftp_server_CASTOR2xroot.o: globus_gridftp_server_CASTOR2xroot.cpp
