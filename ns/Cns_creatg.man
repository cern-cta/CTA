.SH NAME
Cns_creatg \- create a new CASTOR file with the specified GUID or reset it in the name server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
\fB#include "Cns_api.h"\fR
.sp
.BI "int Cns_creatg (const char *" path ,
.BI " const char *" guid ,
.BI "mode_t " mode )
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cns_creatg
creates a new CASTOR file with the specified GUID or resets it in the name server.
.LP
If the file exists, the length is truncated to 0 and the mode and owner
are unchanged.
.LP
If the file does not exist yet, an entry is created in the name server
database and the file's owner ID is set to the effective user ID of the
requestor.
The group ID of the file is set to the effective group ID of the requestor
or is taken from the parent directory if the latter has the
.B S_ISGID
bit set.
.LP
The access permission bits for the file are taken from
.IR mode ,
then all bits set in the requestor's file mode creation mask are cleared (see
.BR Cns_umask (3)).
.LP
.TP
.I guid
specifies the Grid Unique IDentifier.
.TP
.I path
specifies the logical pathname relative to the current CASTOR directory or
the full CASTOR pathname.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This routine returns 0 if the operation was successful or -1 if the operation
failed. In the latter case,
.B serrno
is set appropriately.

.I path
or
.I file_uniqueid
is a NULL pointer.

.I path
prefix is not a directory.
.TP
