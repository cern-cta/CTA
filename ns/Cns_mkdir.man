.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cns_mkdir
creates a new CASTOR directory in the name server.
.LP
An entry is created in the name server database and the directory's owner ID
is set to the effective user ID of the requestor.
The group ID of the directory is set to the effective group ID of the requestor
or is taken from the parent directory if the latter has the
.B S_ISGID
bit set.
.LP
The access permission bits for the directory are taken from
.IR mode ,
then all bits set in the requestor's file mode creation mask are cleared (see
.BR Cns_umask (3)).
The
.BR S_ISGID ,
.B S_ISUID
and
.B S_ISVTX
bits are silently cleared.
.TP
.I path
specifies the logical pathname relative to the current CASTOR directory or
the full CASTOR pathname.

is set appropriately.
