.SH NAME
Cns_readdirx \- read CASTOR directory opened by
.B Cns_opendir
in the name server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
\fB#include "Cns_api.h"\fR
.sp
.BI "struct Cns_direnstat *Cns_readdirx (Cns_DIR *" dirp )
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cns_readdirx
reads the CASTOR directory opened by
.B Cns_opendir
in the name server.
This routine returns a pointer to a structure containing the current directory
entry including the
.B stat
information.
.B Cns_readdirx
caches a variable number of such entries, depending on the filename size, to
minimize the number of requests to the name server.
.TP
.I dirp
specifies the pointer value returned by
.BR Cns_opendir .
.SH RETURN VALUE
This routine returns a pointer to a structure containing the current directory
entry if the operation was successful or NULL if the end of the directory was
reached or if the operation failed. When the end of the directory is encountered,
serrno is not changed. If the operation failed,
.B serrno
is set appropriately.

As Cns_readdirx returns a null pointer
both at the end of the directory and on error, an application wishing to check
for error situations should set
.B serrno
to 0, then call Cns_readdirx, then check
.B serrno
and if it is non-zero, assume an error has occurred.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 1.3i
.B EBADF
File descriptor in DIR structure is invalid.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I dirp
is a NULL pointer.
.TP
.B SENOSHOST
Host unknown.
.TP
.B SENOSSERV
Service unknown.
.TP
.B SECOMERR
Communication error.
