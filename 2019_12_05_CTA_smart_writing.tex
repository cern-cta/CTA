%    Materials : Tier-1s presentations (October-November splinter meetings), FTS, Rucio, ProdSys2¶ 1m

%09:01
%Meeting goals¶ 10m
%
%can we agree on the way forward to cut the following two gaps in the meeting
%
%Gap 1 : between the throughput out of the tape system itself and the throughput delivered to users (rucio in this case)
%--This is to tackle the issues along the staging chain, dCache, FTS, Rucio, PS2, etc, to minimize performance penalties to the original tape throughput
%Gap 2 : between the nominal tape throughput and the current throughput out of tape
%--This is about “smart writing”, by bigger files and/or better organizing files among tapes, to reach higher tape reading efficiency
%Speakers: Alexei Klimentov (Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)), Mario Lassnig (CERN), Xin Zhao (Brookhaven National Laboratory (US))

%ATLAS Sites (topical discussion)¶ 59m
%
%    Planning / notification / feedback /discussions
%    What concerns sites have with tape system throughput (writing/reading) ?
%    -- Active tape drives usage vs drives lifetime (data staging scenario)
%    -- What are the bottlenecks at sites, any planned improvements ?
%    -- What help do they need from ADC, dCache, FTS ? (e.g. sites want the staged files to be transferred out of disk buffer as soon as possible, avoid too many staging retries ...)
%    Site staging profile
%    -- Possible extension ?
%    What can sites do w.r.t. “Smart writing” ?
%    -- new features in tape system ?
%    -- external users (eg. ADC/dCache) to create bigger files and/or better organize the order of files when writing to tape ?
%    What are the special concerns for sites supporting multiple-VO ?
%    -- Do we understand requirements and intended usage of tape resources of other VOs ?
%    monitoring tools enough for sites? any suggestions on improving monitoring ?

%    11:25
%    Topical discussion¶ 1h
%        7 out of 10 T1s run dCache as tape frontend
%        Can dCache provide common solution to improve scalability of dCache HSM interface, something like ENDIT does for TSM sites, that will benefit all dCache sites ?
%        Can dCache group files by datasets in writing to tapes, which will benefit all dCache T1s ?
%        other tape frontend (CTA, StoRM)
%        -- plans ?
%        alternative protocol for tape access ?
%        -- SRM vs QoS APIs ?

\section{The problem}
\begin{frame}{What are we trying to solve?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Datasets are always read whole
    \item Tape systems not dataset-aware during write
    \begin{itemize}    
      \item Files scattered over tapes $\Rightarrow$ more read mounts
      \item Files interleaved with others within tape
      
      $\Rightarrow$ drive spends time positioning on reads
    \end{itemize}
    \item Making files bigger will impact tape performance
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Tape drive typically faster than file system (\SI{360}{\mega\byte\per\second} today, up to \SI{1}{\giga\byte\per\second} in the roadmaps)
      \item Tape server memory should hold several files to allow streaming them in parallel
      \item Typical tape server memory size: \SI{60}{\giga\byte}
      \item Upper bound for efficient file size: \SI{10}{\giga\byte}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Files tagging by dataset name}
\begin{frame}{Files tagging by dataset name}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Per-file property
  \item Type = string
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Can we define a length cap? 
  \end{itemize}
  \item Only rely on comparison (no ordering, ranking...)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{User interface}
\begin{frame}{User interface}
\begin{itemize}
  \item On write, per file tagging
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Has to go through Rucio/FTS/EOS/CTA
  \end{itemize}
  \item Back tagging of existing files (several scenarios)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Executed as a one-off, we could have rule based update script
    \item More general: provide get/set operation per file and leave it to the user
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Tape system optimization}
\begin{frame}{Tape system optimizations}
\adjustbox{minipage=1.18\textwidth, scale=0.85}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Write optimization
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Divide archive queue in per-dataset sub-queue
    \item Make write mounts stick to a dataset (until it is drained)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\Rightarrow$ Contiguous files, zero positioning on read
    \end{itemize}
    \item Possibly cap the per-dataset parallel writes
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\Rightarrow$ Soft-limiting the spreading over tapes
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Repack/defrag
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Repack can then write in an optimized manner (defrag)
    \item Repack input (which files to read) could be dataset driven instead of tape driven
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If extra read mount cost bearable
      \item Will have to take into account tape level constraints as well
      \item Make sure we empty old tapes and not re-repack a target tape
      \item Will it be worth the complexity?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}
\end{frame}

\section{Possible bonus features}
\begin{frame}{Possible bonus features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Multi-level tagging, allowing to better choose the {\em{}next} dataset in a mount
  \item Retrieve by dataset (implies big changes in whole data transfer chain, and possibly hairy error handling)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Timing and parallel developments}
\begin{frame}{Timing and parallel developments}
\begin{itemize}
  \item This concept would take quite some time to implement (many projects involved)
  \item In the shorter term, we plan to rely on the existing
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Temporal collocation
    \item Software RAO will be implemented for LTO drives
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Changes from outside the tape system (bigger files) will push us to a non-optimal working point
  \item With proper hints tape system can optimize read access, knowing that access is done by full dataset
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
