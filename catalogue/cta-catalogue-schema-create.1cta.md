# NAME

cta-catalogue-schema-create --- Create the CTA Catalogue schema

# SYNOPSIS

**cta-catalogue-schema-create** *databaseConnectionFile* \[\--help] \[\--version *schema_version*]

# DESCRIPTION

**cta-catalogue-schema-create** is a command-line tool that creates the
CTA catalogue database schema. It will abort if the **CTA_CATALOGUE**
table is already present in the database.

*databaseConnectionFile* is the path to the configuration file
containing the connection details of the CTA Catalogue database.

# OPTIONS

-h, \--help

:   Display command options and exit.

-v, \--version *schema_version*

:   Version of the CTA Catalogue schema to be created. By default,
    **cta-catalogue-schema-create** creates the latest version of the
    schema. This option allows the creation of an earlier version. This
    is useful for testing the upgrade from an older schema version to a
    newer version.

# EXIT STATUS

**cta-catalogue-schema-create** returns 0 on success.
