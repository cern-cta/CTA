# NAME

cta-rmcd --- CTA Remote Media Changer Daemon

# SYNOPSIS

systemctl start **cta-rmcd** *device_file*\
systemctl stop **cta-rmcd**\
systemctl status **cta-rmcd**

# DESCRIPTION

**cta-rmcd** is the Remote Media Changer daemon, used to control SCSI-compatible tape libraries.

The **cta-taped** daemon requires that **cta-rmcd** is installed and running on the same tape
server as itself. **cta-rmcd** is usually started at system startup time by **systemd** or other
system service management software.

# CONFIGURATION

The port number that **cta-rmcd** will listen on should be defined on client hosts and on the
tapeserver host. The default port number is 5014. It is possible to configure a different port
number in */etc/services*:

> rmc 657/tcp \# CTA Remote Media Changer (cta-rmcd)\
> rmc 657/udp \# CTA Remote Media Changer (cta-rmcd)

This value can be overridden in */etc/cta/cta-rmcd.conf*:

> RMC PORT 5014

It can also be set in the **RMC_PORT** environment variable.

# ENVIRONMENT

RMC_PORT

:   Sets the port number on which **cta-rmcd** will listen.

# FILES

*/etc/cta/cta-rmcd.conf*

:   Configuration file. See **CONFIGURATION** above, and
    */etc/cta/cta-rmcd.conf.example*.

*/var/log/cta/cta-rmcd.log*

:   Log of error messages and statistical information. Log lines with
    code **RMC92** give information about the requestor: (uid,gid) and
    hostname. Log lines with code **RMC98** contain the command that was
    sent to the library. The exit status of each command is also logged.

# EXAMPLE

Example configuration of */etc/systemd/system/cta-rmcd.service*:

    [Unit]
    Description=CERN Tape Archive (CTA) rmcd daemon
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    User=cta
    EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/cta-rmcd
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/cta-rmcd ${CTA_RMCD_OPTIONS}
    LimitCORE=infinity
    Type=forking
    Restart=no

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target

Example configuration of */etc/sysconfig/cta-rmcd*:

    DAEMON_COREFILE_LIMIT=unlimited
    CTA_RMCD_OPTIONS=/dev/smc
