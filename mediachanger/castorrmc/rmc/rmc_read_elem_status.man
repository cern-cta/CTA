.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rmc_read_elem_status
asks the Remote Media Changer server running on
.I server
and connected to the picker
.I smc_ldr
to get the status of the elements of type
.IR type .
.TP
.I server
specifies the Remote Media Changer to be contacted.
.TP
.I smc_ldr
is the picker device as defined in /dev.
.TP
.I type
gives the element type: 0 means all element types, 1 corresponds to the hand,
2 to the storage cells, 3 to the import/export door (CAP) and 4 to the drives.
.TP
.I startaddr
specifies the lowest element address to be searched.
.TP
.I nbelem
gives the maximum number of entries to be returned
.TP
.I element_info
gives the address of the buffer allocated by the calling program to receive the
reply.
