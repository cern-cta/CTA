# DESCRIPTION

**cta-smc** is the SCSI Media Changer client. It controls the mounting,
dismounting and exporting of tapes in a robotic tape library and can be
used to query the state of the library.

# OPTIONS

-d

:   Triggers a dismount operation. The drive must be already unloaded.
    The drive must be specified, but the Volume ID (VID) of the
    cartridge is optional. If -V *vid* is specified, *vid* must match
    the VID on the cartridge to be dismounted.

-D *drive_ordinal*

:   Specify which drive to control or query. *drive_ordinal* is the SCSI
    bus number of the drive, starting from 0.

-e

:   Moves a tape from a storage slot to the export slot (which can be
    virtual). The VID must be specified.

-i

:   Imports either a specific VID (indicated by -V) or all tapes in
    state \"import\" in the import/export slots.

-m

:   Triggers a mount operation. The drive must be free. The drive and
    the VID must be specified.

-N *nb_elements*

:   Specifies the maximum number of entries to be reported.

-q *query_type*

:   Queries the library and produces a report about the state of the
    library. *query_type* may be one of the following:

    D

    :   Produce a list of drives with their status and the VID of the
        mounted tape (if any). The status of all drives is reported,
        unless a specific drive is selected with the -D option.

    L

    :   Prints the result of the SCSI **INQUIRY** command
        (Vendor/Product/Revision). It also gives the starting address
        and the number of slots, drives, ports and transports (robotic
        arms) in the library.

    P

    :   Prints the status of import/export slots.

    S

    :   Prints the status of slots. By default all slots are reported,
        but the starting address may be specified with the -S option,
        and the number of elements to be reported may be specified with
        the -N option.

    V

    :   Prints the status of volumes (tapes). A single VID or a pattern
        may also be specified with the -V option.

-S *starting_slot*

:   Specifies the starting slot address for the query operation.

-V *vid*

:   A full VID or a pattern may be specified using shell wildcard
    characters \'?\' and \'\*\'.

\--json

:   Return query responses in JSON format (for use in scripts).

# EXIT STATUS

0 OK.\
1 Parameter error or unrecoverable error (just log it).\
2 Should release drive and retry in 600 seconds.\
3 Should retry in 60 seconds.\
4 Should first do a demount force.\
5 Should configure the drive down.\
6 Should send a message to the operator and exit.\
7 Ops msg (nowait) + release drive + slow retry.\
8 Should send a message to the operator and wait.\
9 Should unload the tape and retry demount.\
16 Robot busy.

# EXAMPLE

To mount the tape with VID JK2005 on drive 1:

> cta-smc -m -D 1 -V JK2005

To dismount the tape present on drive 1 after checking the VID:

> cta-smc -d -D 1 -V JK2005

To query the main charateristics of the library:

> cta-smc -q L
>
>     Vendor/Product/Revision = <IBM     03584L32        1802>
>     Transport Count = 1, Start = 1000
>     Slot Count = 99, Start = 0
>     Port Count = 1, Start = 1010
>     Device Count = 2, Start = 1030

To query the status of all the drives:

> cta-smc -q D
>
>     Drive Ordinal   Element Addr.   Status          Vid
>              0          1030        free
>              1          1031        unloaded        JK2005

To get the list of a few slots in the library:

> cta-smc -q S -S 20 -N 10
>
>     Element Addr.   Vid
>           20        JK2021
>           21        JK2022
>           22        JK2023
>           23        JK2024
>           24        JK2025
>           25        JK2026
>           26        JK2027
>           27        JK2028
>           28        JK2029
>           29        JK2030

To get the status of tapes for which the VID starts with JK200

> cta-smc -q V -V \'JK200\*\'
>
>     Vid     Element Addr.   Element Type
>     JK2001         0        slot
>     JK2002         1        slot
>     JK2003         2        slot
>     JK2004         3        slot
>     JK2006         5        slot
>     JK2007         6        slot
>     JK2008         7        slot
>     JK2009         8        slot
>     JK2005      1031        drive
