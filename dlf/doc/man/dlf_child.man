.SH NAME
dlf_child \- child process handler for fork(2)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "dlf_api.h"

.BI "void dlf_child (void)"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dlf_child
essentially reverses all the locks on the interface established by a previous call to
.BR dlf_prepare()
and recreates the server threads. It should only ever be called from within the child process. If a previous call to dlf_prepare() was never made, the function will return immediately. If 
.BR dlf_init() 
was called with usethreads = 0, then the threads will not be recreated. To create the threads under this condition a call to 
.BR dlf_create_threads() 
is required.
