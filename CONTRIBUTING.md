# Contributing to CTA

We follow a **trunk-based development** workflow: all changes go into the `main` branch via Merge Requests (MRs).  
Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed.

## Basic Workflow

1. Choose or create an issue to work on.
2. Create a branch for your work.
3. Make your changes.
4. Open a Merge Request into `main`.
5. Ensure all checks pass and request a review.
6. Merge after approval.

## Full Guidelines

All contributors **must** follow the contribution workflow and guidelines described in the [Developer Documentation](https://cta.docs.cern.ch/latest/dev/getting_started/) before starting work.  
Merge Requests that do not follow the documented workflow, coding conventions, and review process may be rejected.

The Developer Documentation includes:

- Environment setup
- Issues and development tracking process
- Branching and merge request process
- Coding conventions
- Continuous Integration
