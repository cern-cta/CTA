# NAME

cta-restore-deleted-files --- Restore deleted files from the CTA Recycle Bin

# SYNOPSIS

**cta-restore-deleted-files** \[\--id *archive_file_id*] \[\--instance *disk_instance*] \[\--fxid *eos_fxid*]
\[\--fxidfile *filename*] \[\--vid *vid*] \[\--copynb *copy_number*] \[\--help] \[\--debug]

# DESCRIPTION

**cta-restore-deleted-files** restores files deleted from CTA that match
some criteria. Recovered files may have been deleted by a user (with
**eos rm**) or by an operator (with **cta-admin tapefile rm**).

There are three scenarios for disk file recovery:

1.  The file has been deleted in the EOS namespace and in the CTA
    catalogue. This happens in the case of a normal file removal by the
    user (**eos rm**). The strategy is to reinject the file metadata
    into EOS and restore the file entry in the CTA catalogue (with a new
    disk file id).

2.  The file has been deleted in the CTA catalogue, but the metadata is
    unchanged in EOS. This can happen during disk draining. The file is
    kept in the EOS namespace but the entry is removed from the CTA
    Catalogue. The strategy is to restore the CTA Catalogue entry.

3.  The file has been deleted in the CTA catalogue and the EOS
    diskFileId changed. This can happen during the conversion of a file
    from a space to another. The strategy is to recover the CTA
    Catalogue entry and update the disk file id to the one that
    corresponds to the metadata in EOS.
