# NAME

cta-admin --- Administrative command-line interface to CTA Frontend

# SYNOPSIS

**cta-admin** \[\--json] \[\--config *path*] *command* \[*subcommand*] \[*options*]

**cta-admin** \--help

# DESCRIPTION

**cta-admin** sends the specified command to the CTA Frontend (see **CONFIGURATION** below).

Invoking **cta-admin** with no command line parameters shows a list of valid commands. To show the
subcommands and options for a specific command, type:

> **cta-admin** *command* help

## Commands

Commands have a long version and an abbreviated version (shown in brackets).

@include_md CtaAdminCmdParser.hpp
# OPTIONS

**\-\-json**

:   Return the output of **cta-admin** as a JSON object rather than columnar text. This option is
    intended for use by scripts to ease automated processing of results.

**\-\-config**

:   Override the default configuration file */etc/cta/cta-cli.conf*.

# CONFIGURATION

**cta-admin** reads its configuration parameters from */etc/cta/cta-cli.conf*.
Each option is listed with its *default* value.

cta.endpoint (no default)

:   Specifies the CTA Frontend hostname (FQDN) and TCP port.

cta.resource.options *none*

:   Currently the only supported option is *Reusable*. For an explanation of XRootD SSI reusable
    resources, see:
    [http://xrootd.org/doc/dev49/ssi_reference-V2.htm#_Toc506323429](http://xrootd.org/doc/dev49/ssi_reference-V2.htm#_Toc506323429).

cta.log *none*

:   Sets the client log level (see **XrdSsiPbLogLevel** below).

cta.log.hiRes *false*

:   Specify whether log timestamps should have second (*false*) or microsecond (*true*) resolution.

# EXIT STATUS

**cta-admin** returns 0 on success.

If there is an error, a message will be printed on *stderr*. XRootD errors, protocol buffer
errors and CTA Frontend errors return exit code 1. User errors (e.g. invalid tape pool or VID) return
with exit code 2.

In the case of user errors, when the **\-\-json** option is specified, **cta-admin** will return an empty JSON array
to *stdout* in addition to the error message printed on *stderr*. Scripts using **cta-admin** should interpret
the error code to determine whether valid parameters were used.

# ENVIRONMENT

XrdSecPROTOCOL

:   Sets the XRootD security protocol to use for client/server connections.

XrdSsiPbLogLevel *none*

:   Set the desired log level. Logging is sent to stderr.

    Available log levels are: *none* *error* *warning* *info* *debug*

    There are two additional debugging flags to expose details of the communication between client and server:

    *protobuf* shows the contents of the Google Protocol buffers used for communication in JSON format\
    *protoraw* shows the serialized Google Protocol buffer, i.e. the binary format sent on the wire

    Log level *all* is a synonym for "*debug* *protobuf* *protoraw*".

XRDDEBUG

:   If the XRootD environment variable XRDDEBUG=1, the log level is set to *all* (see above).

XrdSecDEBUG

:   If the XRootD environment variable XrdSecDEBUG=1, authentication messages are logged. This is
    useful for debugging problems with Kerberos or SSS authentication.

XRDSSIDEBUG

:   If the XRootD environment variable XRDSSIDEBUG=1, debug messages will be displayed for each
    low-level SSI event.

XRD\_REQUESTTIMEOUT *1800*

:   Specifies the timeout (in seconds) for the entire request to be processed: connection to load balancer +
    redirection + connection to data server + request/response round-trip. Normally this should be less than
    one second, but for a heavily-loaded system can take more than one minute.

    The same timeout is also applied to the response for list commands. List commands can return arbitrarily
    long output, but by using the XRootD SSI stream mechanism, the timeout is applied to each packet of the
    response rather than the total time taken to process the response.

XRD\_STREAMTIMEOUT

:   Note that the XRootD stream timeout is explicitly disabled by the XRootD server for SSI requests,
    so this environment variable is **not** used.

XRD\_CONNECTIONRETRY *1*

:   By default, if the connection to the CTA Frontend fails for any reason, **cta-admin** returns
    immediately with **[FATAL] Connection error**. XRD\_CONNECTIONRETRY and XRD\_CONNECTIONWINDOW
    can be used to configure retry behaviour. Note that Connection Retry is a misnomer as it sets
    the total number of attempts, not the number of retries.

# FILES

*/etc/cta/cta-cli.conf*

:   See **CONFIGURATION** above, and */etc/cta/cta-cli.conf.example*.

*/etc/cta/eos.grpc.keytab*

:   gRPC keys for each instance, used by **cta-admin tapefile ls** to display disk metadata associated with
    files on tape. The format is one line per disk instance, as follows:

        # disk instance  endpoint (host:port)         gRPC token
        eosctaphysics    eosctaphysics.cern.ch:50051  bf8d9c49-2eda-40bd-82aa-630a556caf31

# BUGS

When using the **\--json** option, 64-bit integer fields are returned as strings. This is a feature of the
Google Protocol Buffers library, to cope with the fact that JavaScript parsers do not have the ability
to handle integers with more than 32-bit precision.
