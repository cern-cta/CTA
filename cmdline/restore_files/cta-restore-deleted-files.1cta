.SH NAME
cta-restore-deleted-files \- Restore files deleted from cta
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "cta-restore-deleted-file [OPTIONS]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcta-restore-deleted-files\fP is a command-line tool for restoring files deleted from cta that match some criteria.

The tool recovers files that have been deleted by a user, by EOS or by an operator using cta-admin tf rm.

There are tree scenarios for disk file recovery:

1. The file has been deleted in the EOS namespace and in the CTA catalogue
   This happens in the case of a normal file removal from the user (eos rm).
   The strategy is to reinject the file metadata in EOS and restore the file
   entry in the cta catalogue (with a new diskFileId)

2. The file has been deleted in the CTA catalogue but the EOS diskFileId remains the same
   This can happen during a disk draining. The file is kept in the EOS namespace
   but the entry is removed from the Catalogue. The strategy is to just
   restore the CTA Catalogue entry.

3. The file has been deleted in the CTA catalogue but the EOS diskFileId changed
   This happens during the conversion of a file from a space to another. The strategy is to recover the
   CTA Catalogue entry and update the diskFileId to the one that corresponds to its EOS entry.
