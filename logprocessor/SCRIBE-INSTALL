Installation notes for Scribe :

1*) Install the RPM (with --nodeps options if needed)

2*) Change line 289 of /usr/lib/log-processor/LoggingCommon.py to :
   path += "%d%02d%02d/c2aggregated_00000" % (p.year, p.month, p.day))

   (stefano's hack to let if work with Scribe)

3*) Create the directory /usr/bin/metrics and put metrics in it.

4*) Change if needed COCKPIT_PUSH_URL in /usr/lib/log-processor/MetricsAnalysisEngine_dest.py

5*) Start the daemon :
    # /etc/init.d/logprocessord start
