# Build XRootD RPMs

The version of xrootd.spec.in in the xrootd xrdssiV2 branch does not package the SSI library and header files.

This is the temporary home for the patched version of xrootd.spec.in, until Michal or Andy can integrate it
properly into the xrootd git respository.

To build the RPMs:
```
./build-rpms
```
