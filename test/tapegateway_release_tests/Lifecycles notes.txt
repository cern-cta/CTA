Lifecycles notes
================

Creation and transistions of tapecopies, status by status (hopefully not missing any due to hardcoded state values).

- TAPECOPY CREATED (0)
In orastager.sql: internalPutDoneFunc creates it, only references castorfile.
In oracleTape.sql: fileRecalled creates it with a copynb = 0 for remigration of missing tapecopies. (Yuck!) Same as previous otherwise.
In oracleTapeGateway: tg_setFileRecalled, ditto.

- TAPECOPY TO BE MIGRATED (1)
