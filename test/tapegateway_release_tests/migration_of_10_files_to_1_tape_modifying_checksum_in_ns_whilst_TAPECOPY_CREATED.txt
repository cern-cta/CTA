THE NAME OF TEST
================

Migration of 10 files to 1 tape modifying checksum in ns whilst
TAPECOPY_CREATED.

THE PURPOSE OF THE TEST
=======================

The principle responsibility of the tape gateway is to coordinate the transfer
of files to and from tape.

This test verifies that the tape-gateway will fail the migration of a file with
a bad checksum.

The tape-gateway is responsible for retying failed migrations based on a
user-define policy. The tape-gateway does this by executing a Python-script
which provides the policy user-coded logic for deciding whether or not a failed
migration should be repeated based on the error code that is being generating
and the number of prevous retries.


THE PREREQUISITES OF THE TEST
=============================

* A test-stager running the tape-gateway where you can carry out the test.
* A test-service-class with a set of one or more disk-pools that has enough
  free space to store ten 100MB on disk.
* A user account that permits the modification of the service-class within the
  stager.
* One test-tape which must have enough free space to store ten 100MB files.
* A user account that permits the creation of a new tape-pool within the VMGR.
* One free tape-drive which can access the test-tape.
* A user account that permits the dedication of drives within the VDQM.
* A file class with one tape-copy or a user account that permits the creation
  of a new one with one tape-copy.  Do not modify the number of tape-copies
  attribute of an existing file class.
* A user account that allows the creation and population of a CASTOR directory
  with a tape backend.
* A copy of the utility test script from the CASTOR svn repository,
  "trunk/test/tapegateway_release_tests/createAndCopyFilesToCastor.sh".
* Set TAPEGATEWAY REC_RETRY_POLICY in castor.conf to point to a Python module
  which contains a function of the same name which returns 0 in the case of a
  SECHECKSUM error code.


INSTRUCTIONS DESCRIBING HOW TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE TEST
=================================================================

1. Check that the tapeGateway is up and running.

ps -ef | grep 'tapegatewayd|rtcpclientd' | grep -v grep

2. Create yourself a tape-pool containing the test-tape.

vmgrenterpool --name gatewaytest --user murrayc3 --group c3
vmgrmodifytape -V I12017 --pool gatewaytest

3. Make sure the test service-class has the test tape-pool as its one and only
   tape-pool.

modifySvcClass --Name default --AddTapePools gatewaytest

4. Make sure the test service-class will use exactly 1 drive for migrations.

modifySvcClass --Name default --NbDrives 1

5. Create the empty test-directory in CASTOR where test-files will be copied
   to.

nsmkdir /castor/cern.ch/dev/m/murrayc3/migrate_10_files_with_wrong_checksum

6. Determine the name of a file-class with one tape-copy.

nslistclass | egrep 'CLASS_ID|CLASS_NAME|NBCOPIES' | grep -B2 'NBCOPIES 1'
[output] ...
[output] CLASS_ID 95
[output] CLASS_NAME largeuser
[output] NBCOPIES 1 
[output] ...

7. Set the file-class of the test-directory to be that of the previous step.

nschclass largeuser /castor/cern.ch/user/m/murrayc3/migrate_10_files_with_wrong_checksum

8. Dedicate the test-drive to the test-stager.

vdqm_admin -dedicate -dgn 359B1B -drive 35921011 -server tpsrv212 -match 'host=lxcastordev04'

9. Determine whether or not there is a migHunter daemon running for the test
   service-class. 
    
ps -ef | egrep "/usr/bin/mighunterd.* largeuser" | grep -v grep

10. If the previous step shows the mighunter daemon is running, then shut it
    down as user root.

ps -ef | egrep "/usr/bin/mighunterd.* largeuser" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'| xargs kill



INSTRUCTIONS DESCRIBING HOW TO CARRY OUT THE TEST
=================================================

1. Create and copy to CASTOR the ten 100MB test-files using the
   createAndCopyFilesToCastor.sh script.

sh createAndCopyFilesToCastor.sh lxcastordev04 default lxcastorsrv101 /castor/cern.ch/dev/m/murrayc3/migrate_10_files_with_wrong_checksum 100 10

2. Waiting for all 10 files to be in TAPECOPY_CREATED (tragic number 0).

SQL> SELECT castorfile.lastknownfilename, tapecopy.status AS tapecopy_status
       FROM castorfile
            INNER JOIN tapecopy ON (castorfile.ID = tapecopy.castorfile)
      WHERE lastknownfilename like '%/migrate_10_files_with_wrong_checksum/%';

3. Display the current checksum value for each of the 10 test-files.

TESTDIR=/castor/cern.ch/dev/n/nbessone/migrate_10_files_with_wrong_checksum; for F in `nsls -l $TESTDIR | awk '{print $NF;}'`; do nsls -l --checksum $TESTDIR/$F | awk '{print $10" " $NF}'; done

4. Use nssetchecksum to invalidate the checksum value of each o the 10
   test-files.

TESTDIR=/castor/cern.ch/dev/n/nbessone/migrate_10_files_with_wrong_checksum; for F in `nsls -l $TESTDIR | awk '{print $NF;}'`; do nssetchecksum -n AD --checksum=99999999 $TESTDIR/$F; done

5. Start the mighunter daemon for the test service-class.

/usr/bin/mighunterd -t 60 largeuser

6. Wait for the status of the tapecopy of each test-file to become
   TAPECOPY_FAILED (tragic number 6).

SQL> SELECT castorfile.lastknownfilename, tapecopy.status AS tapecopy_status
       FROM castorfile
            INNER JOIN tapecopy ON (castorfile.ID = tapecopy.castorfile)
      WHERE lastknownfilename like '%/migrate_10_files_with_wrong_checksum/%';


EXPECTED RESULTS
================

The tape-gateway should have failed all 10 of the test-files being migrated to
tape.  In addition to the status output of step 6 of the above test
instructions, nsls -l should show that none of the 10 test files have been
migrated.  The following command-line should therefore display 0 as its result.

nsls -l /castor/cern.ch/dev/n/nbessone/migrate_10_files_with_wrong_checksum | egrep -v '^m' | wc -l
[output] 0


INSTRUCTIONS DESCRIBING HOW TO TEAR DOWN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE TEST
====================================================================

1. Revoke the dedication the test-drive from the test-stager.

vdqm_admin -dedicate -dgn 359B1B -drive 35921011 -server tpsrv212

2. Remove the test-directory and its contents from the CASTOR name-space.

nsrm -r /castor/cern.ch/user/m/murrayc3/migrate_10_files_with_wrong_checksum
