THE NAME OF TEST
================

Recall 10 files with tape ARCHIVED whilst TAPECOPY_WAITINSTREAMS.


THE PURPOSE OF THE TEST
=======================

The principle responsibility of the tape gateway is to coordinate the transfer
of files to and from tape.

This test verifies that the tape-gateway will fail the recall of a file 
if the tape containing it is move to an ARCHIVED state.

The tape-gateway is responsible for retying failed recall based on a
user-define policy. The tape-gateway does this by executing a Python-script
which provides the policy user-coded logic for deciding whether or not a failed
recall should be repeated based on the error code that is being generating
and the number of prevous retries.


THE PREREQUISITES OF THE TEST
=============================

* A test-stager running the tape-gateway where you can carry out the test.
* A test service-class with the following properties:
  - A set of one or more disk-pools that has enough free space to store ten
    100MB test-files.
  - Recaller policy set to 'None'.
* A user account that permits the modification of the service-class within the
  stager.
* One free tape-drive which can access the test-tape.
* A user account that permits the dedication of drives within the VDQM.
* A copy of the utility test script from the CASTOR svn repository,
  "trunk/test/tapegateway_release_tests/createAndCopyFilesToCastor.sh".
* Set TAPEGATEWAY REC_RETRY_POLICY in castor.conf to point to a Python module
  which contains a function of the same name which returns 0 in the case of a
  ENOENT error code.


INSTRUCTIONS DESCRIBING HOW TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE TEST
=================================================================

1. Check that the tapeGateway is up and running.

ps -ef | grep 'tapegatewayd' | grep -v grep

2. Identify a test-directory in CASTOR where contain 10 files.

3. Chech that the files are stored on tape.

nsls -l /castor/cern.ch/dev/m/murrayc3/<folder_name> | egrep -v '^m' | wc -l
[output] 0

4. Chech that the file are not on disk.

stager_qry -M /castor/cern.ch/dev/m/murrayc3/<folder_name>

5. If the previous test show that the files are on disk, stager_rm them.

stager_rm -M /castor/cern.ch/dev/m/murrayc3/<folder_name>

6. Make sure the test service-class will use exactly 1 drive for recall.

modifySvcClass --Name default --NbDrives 1

7. Dedicate the test-drive to the test-stager.

vdqm_admin -dedicate -dgn 359B1B -drive 35921011 -server tpsrv212 -match 'host=lxcastordev04'


INSTRUCTIONS DESCRIBING HOW TO CARRY OUT THE TEST
=================================================

1. Stop the tepegateway daemon.

/usr/bin/tapegatewayd stop

2. stager_get the 10 files.

TESTDIR=/castor/cern.ch/dev/m/murrayc3/<folder_name>; for F in `nsls -l $TESTDIR | awk '{print $NF;}'`; do stager_get -M $TESTDIR/$F; done

3. Waiting for all 10 files to be in TAPECOPY_CREATED (tragic number 0).

SQL> SELECT castorfile.lastknownfilename, tapecopy.status AS tapecopy_status
       FROM castorfile
            INNER JOIN tapecopy ON (castorfile.ID = tapecopy.castorfile)
      WHERE lastknownfilename like '%/<folder_name>/%';

4. Display the current checksum value for each of the 10 test-files.

TESTDIR=/castor/cern.ch/dev/m/murrayc3/<folder_name>; for F in `nsls -l $TESTDIR | awk '{print $NF;}'`; do nsls -l --checksum $TESTDIR/$F | awk '{print $10" " $NF}'; done

5. Modify the status of the test_tape(s) to ARCHIVED.

TAPES=`nsls -lT  /castor/cern.ch/dev/n/nbessone/<folder_name> | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq`;
for I in $TAPES; do vmgrmodifytape -V $I --st ARCHIVED; done;

6. Start the tepegateway daemon.

/usr/bin/tapegatewayd start

7. Wait for the status of the tapecopy of each test-file to become
   TAPECOPY_FAILED (tragic number 6).

SQL> SELECT castorfile.lastknownfilename, tapecopy.status AS tapecopy_status
       FROM castorfile
            INNER JOIN tapecopy ON (castorfile.ID = tapecopy.castorfile)
      WHERE lastknownfilename like '%/<folder_name>/%';


EXPECTED RESULTS
================

The tape-gateway should have failed all 10 of the test-files being recalled from
tape.  In addition to the status output of step 6 of the above test
instructions, nsls -l should show that none of the 10 test files have been
recalled.  The following command-line should therefore display 0 as its result.

nsls -l /castor/cern.ch/dev/n/nbessone/<folder_name> | egrep -v '^m' | wc -l
[output] 0


INSTRUCTIONS DESCRIBING HOW TO TEAR DOWN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE TEST
====================================================================

1. Revoke the dedication the test-drive from the test-stager.

vdqm_admin -dedicate -dgn 359B1B -drive 35921011 -server tpsrv212

2. Set to the original status the test_tape(s).

TAPES=`nsls -lT  /castor/cern.ch/dev/n/nbessone/<folder_name> | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq`;
for I in $TAPES; do vmgrmodifytape -V $I --st ""; done;
