Here we test a compression ratio statistics for files.
The test is not critical as soon as in any case we compress all data on 
tapes but it affects NS DB and VMGR DB.

First we write /dev/urandom file on tape and the compression ratio 
must be 100%.

Second we write /dev/zero file on tape and the compression ratio 
must be greater than 7777%.

In tests for LTO and IBM tapes we have 9394%, for T10000C ~16000%,
for VTL 1.4 with compression factor 9 -  93090% and with compression factor 1 - 22755%
